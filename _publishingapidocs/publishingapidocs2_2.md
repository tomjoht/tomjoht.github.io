## What are design patterns

Design patterns are common themes in the way something is designed. In looking over the many API doc sites, I tried to find some common design patterns in the way the content was published. I already mentioned the division between guides, tutorials, and reference documentation. Here I want to explore more design-specific elements in API doc sites.

## Several design patterns with API docs

Here are several design patterns with API doc sites:

* Structure and templates
* Website platform
* Abundant code examples
* Longish pages
* Interactive API explorers

I'll explore each of these elements in depth in upcoming pages.

## Some non-patterns

Here are some non-patterns. By this, I mean these are elements that aren't as common in API doc sites:

* PDF output
* Mobile display
* Comments on pages
* Video tutorials

By non-patterns, it's not to say these elements aren't a good idea. But generally they aren't emphasized in many of the API doc sites.
