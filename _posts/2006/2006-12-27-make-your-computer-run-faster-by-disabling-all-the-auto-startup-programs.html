<p>Do you have about 20 programs in your start-up folder? Check out the little icons near your computer's clock. That's the system tray. Whatever is in there starts up when your computer starts up -- and consequently makes your computer slower. You can improve the performance of your computer pretty easily by doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Start > Run</strong>.</li>
<li>Type <strong>msconfig </strong>and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Startup</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Clear all the check boxes.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>
