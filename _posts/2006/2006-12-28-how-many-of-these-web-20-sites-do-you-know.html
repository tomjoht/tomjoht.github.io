<p>This article in Wired, <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/15.01/start.html?pg=11" target="_blank">The Best: Web 2.0 Acquisition Bait</a>, lists the top 10 web 2.0 sites that might potentially be bought out by larger corporations.</p>
<p>A friend of mine showed me the article in Wired magazine, and I hadn't visited Wired's site for a while. Surprise -- it's totally a magazine blog, and they've organized it in a very readable way.</p>

<p>The top ten sites are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a></li>
<li><a href="http://digg.com" target="_blank">Digg</a></li>
<li><a href="http://techmeme.com" target="_blank">Techmeme</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wikipedia.com" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></li>
<li><a href="http://zillow.com" target="_blank">Zillow</a></li>
<li><a href="http://technorati.com" target="_blank">Technorati</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.com" target="_blank">Wordpress</a></li>
<li><a href="http://feedburner.com" target="_blank">FeedBurner</a></li>
<li><a href="http://37signals.com" target="_blank">37 Signals</a></li>
<li><a href="http://riya.com" target="_blank">Riya</a></li>
</ol>
<p><br />
I've not heard much about Techmeme and Riya, so I'll have to check them out. But all the rest are pretty familiar. Digg is one of my default home pages, I am always turning to Wikipedia for explanations of things, my wife appraised her parents' house in Utah for about 2 million using Zillow, Technorati is the grand-daddy blog search engine, I listen to WordPress podcasts in addition to using their software, my blog feeds are all routed through Feedburner, and I have a few to-do lists on 37 Signals. But despite using their services, I haven't given any of these companies any money.</p>
<p>I am curious about the platform Wired is using to deliver it's content. It looks like a great way to set up a magazine.</p>
