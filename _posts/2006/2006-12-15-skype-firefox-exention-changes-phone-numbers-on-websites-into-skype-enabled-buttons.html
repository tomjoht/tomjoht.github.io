<p><strong>Update: </strong>For steps on removing the Skype-Firefox extension, <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/internet/firefox/manually-remove-skype-extension-from-firefox/">see this post from howtogeek.com</a>.</p>
<p>Skype 3.0 has just been released. An interesting feature is the Skype extension for Firefox. When you browse a website and see a phone number on the site, the Skype extension automatically converts it into a button that you click to call the person using Skype. Unfortunately, with Skype 3.0, calls to cell and home phones now cost money.</p>
<p>Here's a picture of the button:</p>
