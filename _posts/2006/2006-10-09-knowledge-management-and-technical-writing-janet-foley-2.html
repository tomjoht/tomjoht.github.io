Duration: 43 min.</p>
<p>Knowledge Management focuses on how an organization identifies, creates, captures, acquires, shares, and leverages knowledge — its most valuable asset. People, systems, and processes support these activities and make them repeatable and sustainable.</p>
<p><br />
Organizations around the globe are recognizing that effective knowledge management strategies will give them the competitive edge they need for enhanced business performance and increased profitability. One only has to Google “knowledge management” and browse the hundreds of results to grasp the importance of becoming familiar with the principles and concepts.</p>
<p>As a technical communicator, you can increase your value and contribution to your organization by broadening your perspective of how knowledge is managed and what your role is (or can be) in fostering a knowledge-sharing culture.</p>
<p>Janet Foley is the Director of Editorial Consulting and Content Standards in the Knowledge Services Organization of PricewaterhouseCoopers.</p>
