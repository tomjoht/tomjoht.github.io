<p>If you have not yet seen or explored Google Groups, I really encourage you to, especially if you are trying to solve a problem. I was able to get oodles of knowledge about macros out of the Word > Tables and Word > Mailmerge groups. I also found good solutions from the Robohelp group. Basically all the Microsoft MVPs hang out on Google Groups. Subscribing to groups and unsubscribing is easy, and of course you can access your group anywhere you have the internet.</p>
