Previously, the podcasts were housed on a different domain (idratherbewriting.com). Recently I decided to integrate the podcasts onto this site instead. From now on, you only have to go to one site -- idratherbewriting.com -- to get both blog and podcasts. Although the podcast is now hosted on the idratherbewriting.com domain, I'm still calling it Tech Writer Voices.</p>
<p>Tech Writer Voices is dedicated to educating technical communicators around the world about the latest trends, practices, and news related to the field of technical communication. The field of technical communication covers a variety of professions, from technical writing to information architecture, usability, information design, web design, and illustration. I'm the host of this show, and I usually interview experts in the field. After downloading these podcasts, you can transfer them to your MP3 player and listen while you drive to work or exercise at the gym.</p>
