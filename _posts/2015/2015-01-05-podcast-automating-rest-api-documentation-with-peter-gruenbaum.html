<li>Why is it more difficult to automate REST API documentation than it is with platform API documentation?</li>
<li>What are some tools used to automate REST API documentation?</li>
<li>How can Swagger, Enunciate, I/O docs, and some other tools be used to automate REST API documentation?</li>
<li>What's your default go-to method for documenting a REST API?</li>
<li>Are dynamic endpoint generators like Swagger helpful for developers in learning an API?</li>
<li>Do automated documentation tools for REST reduce documentation drift?</li>
<li>How do you integrate notes, code samples, and other information into an automated doc format like Swagger?</li>
<li>Can you build a mock sample with Swagger without having a real API?</li>
<li>Are videos popular with API documentation?</li>
<li>Is API documentation only a good option if you love code?</li>
