<p>In this podcast, I talk with Mark Baker from <a href="http://everypageispageone.com/">Every Page Is Page One</a> about unifying the API doc publishing toolchain. Here are some questions I ask Mark during the podcast:</p>
<ul>
<li>What kinds of API docs pose challenges with the tool chain?</li>
<li>Do API reference docs need to be separate from other docs?</li>
<li>How do you integrate API reference with non-API reference info?</li>
<li>How do you extract source code comments from Java or C++ and push them into another publishing chain?</li>
<li>How can the structure of source-code comments be parsed and transformed into another format?</li>
<li>Is there value in publishing Java API doc in a syntax familiar to Java developers (Javadoc)? same with C++ (Doxygen)?</li>
<li>What are the best publishing strategies for REST API documentation?</li>
<li>Is XML (as opposed to Markdown or some other format) the right markup for API doc?</li>
<li>What are some limitations with DITA with respect to publishing API doc?</li>
<li>What advantages does SPFE have for API documentation?</li>
<li>What is a top-down architecture versus a bottom-up architecture?</li>
<li>What do you mean by tightly coupled versus loosely coupled?</li>
<li>What are your thoughts on single-page docs (such as <a href="https://parse.com/docs/android_guide">parse</a>) that load more content on scroll versus docs that separate out into multiple pages?</li>
<li>Are there any API doc sites that you think serve as particularly good examples of how to do API documentation right?</li>
<li>Can StackOverflow be considered API documentation?</li>
</ul>
