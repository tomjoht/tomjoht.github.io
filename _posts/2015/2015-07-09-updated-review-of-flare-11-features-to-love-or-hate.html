<p><i>The following is a guest review by <a href="http://karenrempel.com/">Karen Rempel</a>, a technical writer based in New York and Vancouver.</i></p>

<p>It's been over seven years since Tom wrote his <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2008/01/31/45-things-i-love-about-flare-31-things-i-hate-about-it/">review of MadCap Flare v3</a>. Over the years, hundreds of writers and potential Flare users have consulted his review to decide whether Flare will suit their needs.</p>
    
<p>Flare is up to v11 now, and I recently embarked on a robust project that allowed me to use many of the Flare features. The project involved generating four role-based training plans in both PDF and web help format, ranging in length from 80 to 120 pages. Tom kindly agreed to let me write this guest entry for his blog to provide some current analysis of MadCap Flare.</p>

<p>Like Tom, I love Flare, and the love affair makes me view the weak points with indulgence—more so than with other software that has exasperated me from time to time! So this review may be slightly biased in Flare's favor. </p>

<h2>8 New Things to Love</h2>

<p>Obviously there are hundreds of improvements between v3 and v11. Since I haven't kept track from release to release, I'll just focus on the impressions I gathered using v10 and then updating to v11. There are great things in both versions that didn't exist when Tom wrote his review of v3.</p>
<p>I'm going to use a slightly different scoring system than Tom did last time, ranking the impact of a feature on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being most important. And then rating the success of the feature from 1 to 5 as well, with 5 being excellent and 1 being poor.</p>

                Some software designers seem to be moving away from keyboard shortcuts. I've watched many people working on computers, and newer users are completely mouse-reliant, even for things like copy and paste. For old-timers like me, the keyboard is the thing, and I appreciated the fact that the shortcuts are provided in tooltips. I made a handy cheat sheet on a post-it and speeded up my work time considerably.

                I worked with a small team of reviewers, and we tested the usability of reviews with both Flare and Contributor. It's easy to select all or some files and send them out for review via email directly within Flare. The reviewer can make changes and easily send the review package back. Seamless and simple.
                <br/><br/>There was a small glitch integrating with Microsoft Outlook the first time I sent out a review package, but after that, easy-peasy. I suggest to users that they rename the review package with the reviewer's initials before importing it back into the project.

                This is one of the significant visible changes from v10 to v11. It took a bit of getting used to, but it is very handy, showing successive builds in a spreadsheet format, with a tracking bar for build progress, summaries of errors and warnings, and menu options at the top.

I even tried coding the cross-reference link directly in the html code, but it doesn't work. I guess because the footer is in a page layout, and the page layout is applied to topics. So it can't refer to a topic because it might be referring to itself? I reported this limitation to MadCap Flare as a bug.</td>

                ?? Not sure what Tom means by intelligent cursor behavior. The cursor seems to work as expected most of the time with regular text, but is difficult to work with in master pages, and in tables it can sometimes be difficult to select the desired text. The positioning of the cursor is not quite aligned with WYSIWYG, and it can be very frustrating at times.

                Still a bit unpredictable in how the table styles from the Table Editor override styles in the CSS, but the help does try to explain the precedence rules. I found that if I applied formatting in the Table Editor, I could override some features by adding a new style to the CSS. But if I opened the Table Editor again, it overwrote the style in the CSS. In general, I would say avoid the Table Editor.
