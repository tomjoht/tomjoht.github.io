## A Free Course on DITA

One common question I receive from people on this site is how they can learn DITA. [Scriptorium](http://scriptorium.com) has published a new online course (their first, I think) called [LearningDITA.com](http://www.learningdita.com/). The first course available is "Introduction to DITA."

## About the course

The course is well-organized and oriented for beginners. Here are some general characteristics of the course:

* The course is primarily text-based, but there are about half a dozen short 1-minute videos peppered throughout. (I could hear Sharon Burton's voice in the videos.)
* After each lesson, there's a quiz to test your knowledge. The quizzes aren't hard, but if you don't pass, you must retake the quiz in its entirety. (If you get a wrong answer, an explanation of the correct answer appears.)
* There aren't many mentions of tools, but when there is mention, OxygenXML is noted briefly. (Oxygen is one of the site's sponsors.)
* There are links to additional learning resources (often to the [DITA Style Guide](http://www.oxygenxml.com/dita/styleguide/webhelp-feedback/index.html#Artefact/Maps/c_The_topicref_Element.html)) for each lesson.
* Some of the questions involve drag-and-drop activities to match topics with descriptions. (I liked the interactivity of the drag-and-drop.)
* The course lasts about an hour. Some of the concepts covered include topic types, tables, links, relationship tables, conrefs, and maps.
* When you finish the course, it just shows all modules being complete. (You don't get a certificate or anything, which is what a lot of new technical writers want.)

## Who created the course
Multiple contributors put together the course. From what I could tell, the main contributors included:

* Simon Bate
* Sharon Burton
* Sarah O'Keefe
* Bill Swallow

## What the course is built on

The content for learningdita.com was developed using the DITA learning specialization. As [explained on the About page](http://www.learningdita.com/about/):

>The content is written in DITA using the DITA learning specialization. LearningDITA.com runs on WordPress; we created XSLT transforms to publish the content here.

It's interesting to see that Scriptorium created XSLT transforms to publish DITA to WordPress. I think that's a great example of publishing DITA content.

## Overall feedback

My overall feedback about the course is that I thought there should be more hands-on activities. People primarily learn by doing, so there should be more activities that help people create the content talked about in the course.

To credit, there is a lesson that shows how to create a topic in Oxygen, but that's it. I think there should be a walk-through from beginning-to-end on how to get a simple DITA project authored and published.

 Most of the information needed to create a project is provided in the course, more or less, with easy code samples that one could copy and paste. But it would be nice to see an actual step-by-step tutorial for executing a project inside Oxygen or some other tool. Since this is just the "Introduction," maybe a future course will provide this detail.

## Why am I reviewing this course?

If you know me, you may wonder why I'm reviewing a course on DITA, since I [abandoned DITA for Jekyll](/2015/01/28/10-reasons-for-moving-away-from-dita/) some months ago.

Well, I'm interested in seeing different approaches to online courses and learning. Whereas [Peter Gruenbaum's course on API documentation](/2015/07/24/udemy-course-on-api-technical-writing-part-two/) was primarily video-based, the [learningdita.com course](http://learningdita.com/) is primarily text-based.

Also, I'm trying to highlight more newsworthy events on my blog, and this course on DITA is a first of its kind. Congrats to [Scriptorium](http://scriptorium.com) for making this information available for free on the web.
