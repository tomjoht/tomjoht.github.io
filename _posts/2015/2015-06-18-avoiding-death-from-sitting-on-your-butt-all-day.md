I'm growing increasingly nervous by the number of studies that show how sitting down all day poses health risks equivalent to smoking a pack a day. Just google [sitting all day is the equivalent to smoking](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=sitting%20all%20day%20is%20the%20equivalent%20to%20smoking) and you'll find plenty of articles.

I decided to download [Break Time](http://breaktimeapp.com/) from the App store.

So far it works pretty well. The timer cycles down every 20 minutes and dims your computer screen, prompting you to take a break. I then get up and stretch my legs and walk around a bit. It's simple but effective.
