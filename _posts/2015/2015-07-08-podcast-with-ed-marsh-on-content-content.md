If you like podcasts, check out episode 4 of Ed Marsh's [Content Content podcast](http://edmarsh.com/2015/07/08/content-content-podcast-episode-4-curse-of-knowledge-with-tom-johnson). Ed talks with me at length about a variety of tech comm topics &mdash; everything from how I got into technical writing to publishing tools, DITA, Jekyll, Markdown, and more.

Chatting with Ed made me remember how much I like both listening to and recording podcasts. I think he's given me renewed enthusiasm for recording more regular podcasts.
