I'm actually helping identify topics and speakers for the WTD events (as well as for the STC Silicon Valley chapter). I seem to know quite a few people, and I like connecting with various professionals in the area.

I'm impressed by the momentum of Write the Docs. It seems to be growing quickly in many areas of the world. It's free to join, the meetings are often advertised through meetup.com. There's even a [Write the Docs Slack channel you can join](http://slack.writethedocs.org/). Slack is like IRC or chatroom software that enables groups to interact.
