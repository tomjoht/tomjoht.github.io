<p>I have the opportunity of attending the <a href="http://conferences.tekom.de/tcworld-india-2015/">tcworld India 2015 conference</a> this week in Bangalore. I'm giving a keynote presentation on the topic of innovation and a workshop on API documentation. I posted my slides here in case you're interested:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://tomjohnson1492.github.io/innovation">Innovation in technical communication (HTML)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://idratherbewriting.com/wp-content/apiworkshop/apidoc_tcworldindia.zip">API documentation workshop (Zip)</a> + <a href="https://github.com/tomjohnson1492/apiworkshop">workshop files</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes about the slides</h2>
<p>As I mentioned in the <a href="http://idratherbewriting.com/2015/03/11/reveal-js-an-html5-alternative-to-powerpoint-with-support-for-svg-graphics/">previous post</a>, the slides for the innovation keynote are in HTML5 using Reveal JS. In contrast, the slides for the API documentation workshop are in PowerPoint. This is because I had already prepared most of the workshop in PowerPoint before discovering Reveal JS.</p>
<p>Although I have notes in the innovation slides, you probably won't get much out of them without hearing the actual content. I plan to record and post the recording soon.</p>
<p>Note that I have given multiple API documentation presentations/workshops and posted them on my blog. This time around, I condensed some of the material and incorporated more Javadoc content. I have about 130 slides for a 90-minute time slot, which is probably 30 slides too many. I will also record and post the workshop as well.</p>
