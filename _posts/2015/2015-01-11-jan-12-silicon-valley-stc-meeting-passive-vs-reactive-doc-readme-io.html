<p>If you're in the San Francisco Bay area (near Santa Clara), come join us Monday, January 12 at around 7pm for a presentation by Greg Koberger on <a href="http://www.stc-siliconvalley.org/2014/11/22/january-12-2015-meeting-passive-vs-reactive-documentation/">passive versus reactive documentation</a>, plus a demo of <a href="http://readme.com">readme.com docs</a>, which is a new cloud platform for REST API documentation that is extremely well-designed.</p>
<p>I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/gkoberger">Greg</a> present at a Write the Docs meeting a few months ago and was impressed. He said he is designer who is obsessed about technical documentation, and has spent countless hours studying best practices for documentation. He used this information to design <a href="http://readme.com">readme.com docs</a>, which seems like a great platform for web-based REST APIs.</p>
<p>If you only come to one STC meeting this month, this is the one to attend!</p>
