If you've ever seen the AMA ("Ask Me Anything") posts [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/), they're special themes in which an interesting or famous person (or some kind of insider) makes him or herself available for questions about anything for about an hour.

Vinish Garg is following this same pattern on Content Hug, and he invited me to do an AMA session on his site. The AMA is scheduled for Thursday, September 17 at 9:00am PST for one hour.

I'll offer candid and transparent responses to any questions you ask me. (I've never participated in this kind of thing, so I'm interested to see how it goes.)
