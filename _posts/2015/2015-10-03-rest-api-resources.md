Here are a few good REST API resources to add to your reading list:

* [An API a Day](http://anapiaday.tumblr.com/). This is a Tumblr blog by Lois Patterson. She's provides brief updates on different API resources she finds.
* [Undisturbed REST: A Guide to Designing the Perfect API](https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/ebook/api/restbook). This is a free book (written by Michael Stowe) that you can download in PDF format. It covers how to design a REST API, with an emphasis on using the RAML spec. Reading this book has helped me understand the philosophy and purpose of using a spec in designing an API.
* [Learn REST: A RESTful Tutorial, by Todd Fredrich](http://www.restapitutorial.com/). This site, by Todd Fredrich, provides some great tutorials on REST APIs.
* [Nordic APIs](http://nordicapis.com/blog/). The Nordic APIs blog (a multi-author site) has some excellent info on a variety of API topics. For example, see this post about the [top specifications for REST API formats](http://nordicapis.com/top-specification-formats-for-rest-apis/).
* [REST API Notes newsletter](http://tinyletter.com/RESTAPINotes). This newsletter, by Matthew Reinbold, has some great API news and analysis.
