Here's a description of the podcast from Jacob's site:

> **Skill #26: Getting Started with API Documentation**
>
> As tech writers consider how to stay relevant in the field, many consider getting started in API documentation. And who can blame them—it’s one of the most trending and highest paying roles in tech writing.
>
> But getting started in API documentation can be intimidating, especially if you’ve never worked with code.
>
> That’s why, in this episode, we have Tom Johnson on the podcast: creator of the tech writing site, I’d Rather be Writing, and technical writer at Amazon.
>
> In this episode, Tom shares how to get started in API documentation, including where the tech writer fits in the API documentation process, what skills tech writers need to excel at API documentation, and where to find the best resources to ramp up those skills.
