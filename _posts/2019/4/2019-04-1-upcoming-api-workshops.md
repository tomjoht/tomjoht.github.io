**Raleigh workshop (STC Carolina) - April 6, 2019**: This workshop is a full-day workshop, 8:30am to 5:00pm, held in the McKimmon Center and sponsored by STC Carolina. See [Documenting REST APIs](https://www.stc-carolina.org/events/documenting-rest-apis/) on the STC Carolina site for more details. You can [register through Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/documenting-rest-apis-tickets-55675973335?ref=elink).

{{site.data.alerts.note}}The Raleigh video recordings are now available to watch here: <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/docapis_course_videos.html">Video recordings of API doc workshops</a>.{{site.data.alerts.end}}

**Denver workshop (STC Summit) - May 5, 2019**: This workshop is a pre-conference workshop before the regular sessions at the STC Summit begin. It's also a full-day workshop. For details, go to the [Summit Schedule](https://summit.stc.org/schedule/) and expand the *API Documentation Workshop* event. Register through the [STC Summit site](https://summit.stc.org/).

To get a sense of the workshop, see my [API documentation course](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/), especially the [workshop activities](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/docapis_workshop_activities.html) section.

I've actually been working on some of my material to include more activities. Also, the content is constantly evolving, and I'm using feedback from each workshop to try to make improvements.

By the way, if you're in the Bay area, also check out the [TC Camp](https://www.tccamp.org) event held on April 26, 2019. TC Camp will also have an [API training](https://www.tccamp.org/2019/03/api-workshop-tccamp-2019/) prior to the unconference, though it's taught by someone else. The popularity of these workshops speaks to their relevance and importance in career development.
