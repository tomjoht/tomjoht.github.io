Discussions focus on considerations for choosing a static site generator, and how to manage the content they consume, from APIs to Git-tracked markdown files. Headless CMS options like API-driven Strapi and Git-wrapper Netlify CMS make an appearance.

Note that unfortunately I was out of town for this episode, but after listening to it, I think it's one of the best we've had. It's especially interesting to compare the docs-as-code tool discussions with this [Tools Selection Podcast](https://www.scriptorium.com/2019/01/tools-selection-podcast/) from Scriptorium. Both podcasts are excellent, but their contrast illuminates how divergent the tooling for documentation has become in the industry.
