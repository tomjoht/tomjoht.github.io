## Podcast topics

Here are some of the API design/usability topics we chat about in the podcast:

* What API usability is, and how usability is the same/different with developer tools
* How writing documentation tests the usability of a product
* What tech writers should look for to know whether an API is designed well
* What to call each of the components in an API (e.g., whether the term "endpoint" should be used)
* How tech writers can influence design and usability when they're so far downstream in the development process
* Best practices for creating tutorials on API doc sites
* Spec-first design versus auto-generating the OpenAPI from the code
* Which framework you would you choose to work with to render the API spec
* Whether we'll eventually move into a state where manually editing the OpenAPI spec code by hand becomes antiquated
* The [Open Map visual diagram](https://openapi-map.apihandyman.io/) that shows the OpenAPI structure
* Recommended APIs that we should learn from and why
* Why providing the OpenAPI spec is important even if you don't generate your docs from it
* How tech writers might interact with their company’s API style/design guide and why
* Whether the reference content and user guide should be separate or seamless

{{site.data.alerts.tip}}If you'd like to explore these ideas in more depth, consider getting a copy of <a href='https://www.manning.com/books/the-design-of-web-apis'><i>The Design of Web APIs</i></a>. I've read the book and found it relevant and helpful to the work of technical documentation.{{site.data.alerts.end}}
