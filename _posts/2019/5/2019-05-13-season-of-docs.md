description: "When I was at the STC Summit last week, I was chatting with Sarah Maddox about Season of Docs. This is a program where technical writers looking to gain experience in the field can work with an open-source organization for a three-month timeframe on specific projects, building up both experience and a portfolio of sample docs. In turn, open-source organizations can benefit from having dedicated, enthusiastic technical writers creating much-needed documentation."

I had heard of Season of the Docs before the Summit, but I didn't realize that <a href='https://ffeathers.wordpress.com/'>Sarah Maddox</a> was the one who organized the whole program. Given the size and scope of this program, it's a really impressive effort &mdash; Sara believes 100% in open-source, and it shows. You can read more about Season of Docs on her blog here: [Season of Docs is now ready for tech writer exploration](https://ffeathers.wordpress.com/2019/05/02/season-of-docs-is-now-ready-for-tech-writer-exploration/).

Getting experience as a new tech writer can be difficult, and despite the many projects on GitHub, finding a good documentation project can be difficult (not to mention the challenge of integrating into the team). Season of the Docs looks like a first-of-its-kind program to bring volunteer tech writers and organizations together. The program even provides a small stipend to each group.

Here's a brief excerpt from the Season of Docs homepage:
