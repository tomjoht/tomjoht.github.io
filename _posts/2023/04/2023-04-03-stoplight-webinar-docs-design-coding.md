The webinar description is as follows: 

> **API Trends Across the Lifecycle Webinar**
> 
> We gathered some of the best industry experts across the full spectrum of the API lifecycle for a panel discussion on API trends, insights, and more. Join Stoplight CTO and host Jason Harmon, as he explore some of these trends with experts across the API design and development phase, adoption and consumption, and the API documentation phase.

The other panelists are API designers and engineers (they co-authored [*A Practical Approach to API Design*](https://leanpub.com/restful-api-design)). The host and moderator is Jason Harmon, CTO of Stoplight. One purpose of the panel is to bring together "experts across the API design and development phase, adoption and consumption, and the API documentation phase." I'll bring the tech writer perspective into the discussion. 

(Note that this isn't a webinar by tech writers about tech comm but rather an API-focused webinar mostly by engineers and designers, with an occasional perspective from tech comm.)
