<a href="https://simplea.com/Treasury/Podcasts/Technical-Content-Sets-in-a-Broader-Ecosystem"><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/crucepodcast-enterprise-and-agile.png" alt="Podcast with Simple A and Cruce Sanders on agile versus the enterprise" style="max-width: 500px"/></a>

The basic question of the post/podcast is how to balance small, independent agile teams with enterprise-wide content strategies. Agile software development seems to favor independent, autonomous teams. In contrast, enterprise content strategy looks to harmonize content across multiple teams and boundaries. In a current software development model where agile dominates as the norm, how do you reconcile larger needs for enterprise content strategy? You can read the article here: <a href='https://idratherbewriting.com/blog/agile-teams-and-enterprise-content-strategy/'>Autonomous Agile Teams and Enterprise Content Strategy: An Impossible Combination?</a>

We also talk about a host of other issues. You can read a full transcript of the podcast in the [episode details](https://simplea.com/Treasury/Podcasts/Technical-Content-Sets-in-a-Broader-Ecosystem). Here are some questions/topics covered:

* How to achieve an integrated customer experience with so many different, autonomous systems each with their own formats, systems, groups, tools, etc.
* How the role of the tech writer has changed over the last decade, and what's driving the evolution
* How to get structured content out of Markdown and ways it can be transformed and ingested into a CCMS
* How to assess your documentation's quality
* How to thrive in the coming years given the rapidly changing landscape
