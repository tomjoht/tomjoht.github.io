The basic question of the post/podcast is how to balance small, independent agile teams with enterprise-wide content strategies. Agile software development seems to favor independent, autonomous teams. In contrast, enterprise content strategy looks to harmonize content across multiple teams and boundaries. In a current software development model where agile dominates as the norm, how do you reconcile larger needs for enterprise content strategy?
