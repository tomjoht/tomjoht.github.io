Also, on my [Podcasts page](/podcasts/), I added some more subscribe buttons:

Overall, podcasting will continue to grow in popularity for a number of reasons:

* It's easier to record and share in-depth content in a podcast. Writing out the same material in a blog post tends to be more time consuming.
* Podcasts create a powerful connection with listeners, since you're basically inviting someone to whisper in your ear for 30 minutes to an hour while you're walking, biking, driving, etc.
* In a time where everyone is socially distanced from each other, we crave the human connection. Podcasts tend to bring us closer together than blog posts because the human voice often captures and portrays more emotional elements than writing.
