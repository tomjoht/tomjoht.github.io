## API the Docs Virtual Series

Last month I posted about the [API The Docs Virtual Series 2020](/blog/api-the-docs-virtual-conference-2020/), with an explanation of the format and upcoming presentations. Here's what the 5th edition covered:

**5th edition: 27 May (6-8pm CEST) â€“ API docs trends & API design**.

* Joan James (Zebra Technologies): How the Open API Specification led to Better REST API Design
* Tom Johnson (Amazon): How Trends in API Documentation Differ from other Tech Comm Trends: Results from a Comprehensive Survey

Here's a description of my presentation:

> **How Trends in API Documentation Differ from Other Tech Comm Trends**
>
> Although informative research has been done to gather general tech comm trends, few surveys limit the responses to only those working in the developer doc space. I recently gathered information about dev doc trends from more than 400 respondents specifically working in dev docs (mostly API docs) through a comprehensive 50-question survey. The results, which you can view <a href="https://www.questionpro.com/t/PGhS9ZgCFE">here</a>, show that the tools, workflows, and challenges for those working in API docs differ in notable ways from those working with other types of docs. In this presentation, I'll both present the findings of this research and analyze their significance. The survey's results can help orient, direct, and validate the experiences of technical writers working in the dev doc space.

Here's a short video teaser introducing the topic:
