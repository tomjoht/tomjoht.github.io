Larry described the topics we chat about as follows:

> * the things he likes about technical writing and how it’s such a good fit for him
> * the scope of API documentation and some examples of content provided via APIs
> * the difference between documenting self-contained programs vs. APIs, which don’t usually provide a solution on their own
> * how developers access and use APIs
> * how API designers balance the need for flexible use of their API content with the need to not overwhelm users of the API with too much content
> * the differences in assessing and contributing to product design with APIs vs. traditional applications
> * the new ways that usability concerns arise and are addressed in API documentation
> * how tech writers and developers collaborate
> * the differences between writing for technical and non-technical audiences
> * his relationships with field engineers, developer advocates, and other customer-facing teammates
> * how he works with engineering teams
> * the importance of transparency in developer documentation
> * how he manages his workflow when he’s supporting multiple teams and products, in particular the importance of being a proactive project manager
> * the unique challenges that solo tech writers face
> * how he feels more engaged in his career when he’s writing about it
> * how his academic background in literary nonfiction has had surprising professional benefits
