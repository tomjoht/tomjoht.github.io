description: "I recently wrote an article for the <i>Institute of Scientific Technical Communicators</i> (ISTC) magazine <i>Communicator</i> called 'Developer documentation trends: How developer documentation trends differ from general technical communication trends.' This article provides the official writeup and analysis from the developer documentation survey that I conducted at the beginning of the year."

You can read the ISTC article in PDF form here:

I also added an HTML version on my API doc course here: [Developer documentation trends â€” survey results](/learnapidoc/docapis_trends.html#developer-documentation-trends-how-developer-documentation-trends-differ-from-general-technical-communication-trends). This writeup is the official presentation and analysis of the data.

Note that I've given two presentations that discuss the results as well:

* [API the Docs recording: How Trends in API Documentation Differ from other Tech Comm Trends](/blog/api-the-docs-virtual-series-fifth-edition-api-doc-trends-design/#api-the-docs-virtual-series)
* [Webinar recording: How Trends in API Documentation Differ from other Tech Comm Trends](/blog/upcoming-webinar-trends-api-docs-differ-from-other-trends/)

A few people have asked whether I'll be doing another survey in the future to see how trends evolve from the ones surveyed here. That might be a good idea. This space changes rather quickly, so perhaps I'll follow up in 2022.
