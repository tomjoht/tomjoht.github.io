## What we chatted about

We talked about two main topics, primarily. First, the [results of the pandemic survey](https://www.questionpro.com/t/PGzGMZhSHg). (I also recently posted thoughts about this here: [Results of Pandemic Impact on Tech Comm survey](https://idratherbewriting.com/blog/results-of-pandemic-impact-on-tech-comm-survey/).)

Second, we discussed the pandemic from the health tech comm perspective, specifically looking at information in some essays Kirk has written on this topic:  
* [Communicating about Covid-19](https://communicating-about-covid19.weebly.com/)
* [Prepositions for Planning Post-COVID-19 Processes](https://communicating-about-covid19.weebly.com/prepositions-for-planning-post-covid-19.html)
