description: "In this article, I provide a strategy for one of the most challenging topics in prompt engineering with docs: using AI to help with code samples. At the extreme end, this could mean using AI to generate code samples from documentation; at the other end, it could mean describing code thatâ€™s already been written. My approach is more of a hybrid between the two. After describing a typical scenario, I explore the difference between test code and application code and why engineers are reluctant to provide code samples in documentation."
