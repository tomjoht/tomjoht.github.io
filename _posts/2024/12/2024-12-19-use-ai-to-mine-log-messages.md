description: "I added a new post on my Prompt engineering series about using AI to mine log messages. This post describes how to use AI to identify important information from scripts that build your reference docs&mdash;information such as warnings about missing documentation or deviations from engineering style. These log messages often whiz by in the terminal during builds, even when those builds are successful. It would be tedious to try to manually read the extensive logs and find relevant messages. AI can help turn the logs into actionable information, identifying warnings about missing documentation."
