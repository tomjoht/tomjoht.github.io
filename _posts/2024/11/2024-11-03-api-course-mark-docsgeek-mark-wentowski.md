The course description is as follows:

> This 6-week bi-weekly course will equip you with essential skills to write industry-standard API documentation. Gain deep insights into REST APIs and API design, set up development environments and tooling for API testing, establish docs-as-code CI-CD pipelines, and use static site generators for API documentation portals. Learn to chart API flows, create step-by-step recipes, and write effective API references, along with get-started guides, code samples, and error handling techniques.

More granular topics are broken out across six separate days:

* Day #1: Foundations and setup
* Day #2: Interacting with APIs
* Day #3: OpenAPI Deep Dive
* Day #4: API design and user flows
* Day #5: API reference, concepts and onboarding
* Day #6: Error handling, code samples, and recipes

It looks like a great course! I interacted with Mark last year in a Coffee and Content webinar titled [Let's talk API docs](/blog/webinar-lets-talk-api-docs). I'm always looking to promote educational resources for API documentation and wish there were many more courses, books, webinars, and other resources for writers. The more tech writers who can execute well in this space, the better it will be for the tech comm industry as a whole. With more knowledge of best practices and techniques, we can reduce the idea that you need to be an engineer to operate successfully with API docs. You may remember my post promoting the [University of Washington's API documentation course](/blog/api-documentation-course-uw-bob-watson) as well.
