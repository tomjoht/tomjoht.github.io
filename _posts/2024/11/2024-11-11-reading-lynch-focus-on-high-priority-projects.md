description: "Although this post by Michael Lynch titled <a href='https://mtlynch.io/why-i-quit-google/'>Why I Quit Google to Work for Myself</a> was published in 2018, it <a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42090430'>trended on Hacker News</a> last week. It caught my attention because I recently underwent a similar promotion process, though with a positive outcome. Lynch, an engineer, highlights a couple of points relevant to technical writers: writing documentation doesn't support an engineer's demonstration of technical complexity, and the projects you work on might matter more than the quality of your output."

## Documentation doesn't help engineering promotions

In one of his attempts at promotion, Lynch noted that for one of his projects he "documented the pipeline as I learned it so that the institutional knowledge was available to my teammates instead of siloed in my head." A cartoon graphic in his post demonstrates what happened:

<figure><a class="noCrossRef" href="https://mtlynch.io/why-i-quit-google/"><img src="{{site.media}}/promo-committee-dave.png" alt="Writing docs is not important for engineering promotion" /></a><figcaption>Writing docs is not important for engineering promotion</figcaption></figure>

Because engineers are measured by their contributions to projects with high technical complexity, writing documentation will likely be an insignificant footnote for most promotion committees. It's not a factor in a promo packet in which an engineer must demonstrate how they solved problems involving significant technical complexity. Hence, documentation efforts for most engineers will be put aside because it doesn't fit into their promotion trajectory. This might help explain why engineers never seem to want to contribute to documentation, even if they're capable of writing. Lynch writes, 

> "I submitted my first promo packet, and the results were what I feared: the promotion committee said that I hadn't proven I could handle technical complexity ...."

## The importance of working on high-impact projects

The second highlight from this post is Lynch's attempt to contribute to an impactful project. Lynch explains:

> "To continue advancing my career, I'd need projects that were even larger in scope and involved collaboration with more partner teams." 

If you work on projects no one cares about, it's also hard to get promoted. Many of his projects were canceled six months in. I think one reason I was successful in my promotion effort is because of the business group I'm in. The products are a profit center with many high-profile partners and impact. It matters a lot to people in the organization, and I'm the only tech writer for these efforts. In contrast, if I were working on a product that was much less significant to the company's business interests, then no matter how  awesome the documentation I created, it wouldn't matter much because the product area wouldn't be significant to the company.

I've written before about company layoffs and how tech writers can provide value to companies. (See my series titled [Reflecting seven years later about why we were laid off](/blog/reflecting-seven-years-later-about-layoff-intro/).) Lynch's post suggests that it doesn't matter how good of a programmer you are; what matters is the importance of the projects you work on. I think I intuitively understood this, because I've consistently gravitated toward more important business areas in the documentation I work on. When I was at Amazon, it was Fire TV more than Kindle and other devices. At Google, it's the automotive API products.

In technical writing roles, you have a surprising ability to focus your efforts on documentation projects you believe in. I have about 60+ documentation bugs sitting in my queue. Which ones do I work on? Which do I prioritize? If a product has an upcoming release, sure, I make sure we have docs for those features. Or if partners are complaining loudly about an issue, I also prioritize those fixes. But beyond those P0 type bugs, there's a lot of leeway to ignore some products and prioritize others. Making that judgment call could be more significant than the quality of documentation you write. In other words, instead of focusing so much on documentation quality, focus on documentation priority. Are you working on products that matter to the company? That decision might matter more in your promotion efforts than the quality of documentation you write.

In one [comment on Hacker News by "nostrademons"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42090430), an engineering manager explains that getting promoted is also highly dependent on the manager's ability to articulate your value in the context of business-significant projects:

> "Nobody knows or cares how good a programmer you are. Nobody really cares how hard you work either. Your ability to get promoted is basically dependent upon how well your manager knows how to work the system and then whether you listen to your manager.
> 
> The last promotion packet hinged on work that took him maybe a couple months to do, but that I managed to spin into a big complex project, because it was stuff that folks at the Director/VP level cared about deeply but had no idea how to do â€¦"

I'm more and more convinced of that point of view. There are some weeks where I might work extra hard, putting in additional time in the evenings and weekends, and other weeks where I just coast. No one seems to notice from week to week. What matters more is my general alignment on important, high-impact projects that matter to the business. And more importantly, my manager's ability to understand that integration and to highlight my involvement in those projects, explaining my role in these complex, high-impact projects to promotion committees.
