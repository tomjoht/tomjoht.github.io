description: "Although this post by Michael Lynch titled <a href='https://mtlynch.io/why-i-quit-google/'>Why I Quit Google to Work for Myself</a> was published in 2018, it <a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42090430'>trended on Hacker News</a> last week. It caught my attention because I recently underwent a similar promotion process, though with a positive outcome. Lynch, an engineer, highlights a couple of points relevant to technical writers: writing documentation doesn't support an engineer's demonstration of technical complexity, and the projects you work on might matter more than the quality of your output."

## Documentation dDoesn't help engineering promotions

First, in one of his attempts at promotion, he noted that in one of his projects, he even "documented the pipeline as I learned it so that the institutional knowledge was available to my teammates instead of siloed in my head." The cartoon graphic in his post then says, 

> "I documented this component that nobody understood." To which the committee responds, "Anyone can write documentation. Where are the metrics proving it helped Google?"

As engineers focus on projects with high technical complexity, writing documentation will be an insignificant footnote for most hiring committees. It's not a factor in a promo packet where an engineer would demonstrate how they fixed a problem of significant technical complexity. Hence, documentation efforts for most engineers will be put aside because it doesn't fit into their promotion trajectory. This might help explain why engineers never seem to want to contribute to documentation, even if they're capable of writing. Lynch writes, 

> "I submitted my first promo packet, and the results were what I feared: the promotion committee said that I hadn't proven I could handle technical complexity …."

## The importance of working on high-impact projects

The second highlight from this post is Lynch's attempt to contribute to an impactful project. Lynch explains:

> "To continue advancing my career, I'd need projects that were even larger in scope and involved collaboration with more partner teams." 

If you work on projects no one cares about, it's also hard to get promoted. Many of his projects were canceled six months in. I think one reason I was successful in my promotion effort is because of the business group I'm in. The products are a profit center with many big-name partners and impact. It matters a lot to people in the organization, and I'm the only tech writer for these efforts. In contrast, if I were working on a product that was much less significant to the business interests of the company, then no matter how exceedingly awesome the documentation I created, it wouldn't matter much because the product area wouldn't be significant to the positive impact of the company.

I've written before about company layoffs and how tech writers can provide value to companies. (See my seven-part series [Reflecting seven years later about why we were laid off](https://idratherbewriting.com/blog/reflecting-seven-years-later-about-layoff-intro/).) Lynch's post suggests that it doesn't matter how good of a programmer you are; what matters is the importance of the projects you work on. I think I seemed to intuitively understand this, because I've consistently gravitated toward providing documentation for what I perceive to be the most important projects in a company. When I was at Amazon, it was Fire TV more than Kindle and other devices. At Google, it's the automotive API products.

In technical writing roles, you have a surprising ability to focus your efforts on documentation projects you believe in. I have about 60+ documentation bugs sitting in my queue. Which ones do I work on? Which do I prioritize? Sure, if a product has an upcoming release, I make sure we have docs for those features. Or if partners are complaining loudly about an issue, I also prioritize doc fixes. But beyond those P0 type bugs, there's a lot of leeway to ignore some products and prioritize others. Making that judgment call could be more significant than the quality of documentation you write. In other words, instead of focusing so much on documentation quality, focus on documentation priority. Are you working on products that matter to the company?

In one [comment on Hacker News by "nostrademons"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42090430), an engineering manager explains:

> "Nobody knows or cares how good a programmer you are. Nobody really cares how hard you work either. Your ability to get promoted is basically dependent upon how well your manager knows how to work the system and then whether you listen to your manager.
> 
> The last promotion packet hinged on work that took him maybe a couple months to do, but that I managed to spin into a big complex project, because it was stuff that folks at the Director/VP level cared about deeply but had no idea how to do …"

I'm more and more convinced of that point of view. There are some weeks where I work extra hard, putting in additional time in the evenings and weekends, and other weeks where I seem to coast. No one seems to notice or care. What matters is your general alignment on important, high-impact projects that matter to the business. And more importantly, your manager's ability to understand that and to highlight your involvement in those projects, spinning up your role in these complex, high-impact projects to promotion committees.
