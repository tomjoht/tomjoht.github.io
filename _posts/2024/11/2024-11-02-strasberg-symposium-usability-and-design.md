Here's a more detailed description of the symposium's focus:

> ​As technologies and cultures change, the contexts in which individuals access and use information continually shift in new and often unexpected ways. Accordingly, what constitutes both usable designs and usability is also in a matter of access and accessibility. Such factors also shape usability practices in the interconnected files of technical communication and localization. We therefore need to continually review, reflect on, and – if needed – revise our approaches to understanding usability, technical communication, and localization to effectively address access and accessibility. Such processes should include regular examinations of how each field influences and is influenced by the others in relation to addressing access and accessibility in local, regional, and global contexts.

Although AI isn't mentioned, in discussions about the future of technical communication I have with colleagues and other professionals, the consensus is that we're at at a crossroads in tech comm, in which we'll primarily be writing with machine consumption in mind and focused on the AI chat experience users have. In fact, one colleague argued that informational formats are evolving from websites to chat interfaces as the main way we get information. I have no idea if AI factors into this symposium, but it could. Topics about usability, accessibility, and design seem relevant to this trend.
