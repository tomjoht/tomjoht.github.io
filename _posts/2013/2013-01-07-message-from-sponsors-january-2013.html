<p>If you use Atlassian Confluence for creating documentation, you might have noticed that it lacks something that is essential for technical writing — a reviewing feature. Talk Plugin can fix that. Talk Plugin for Confluence allows you to leave your comments everywhere on Confluence pages and blogs and take part in discussions with your colleagues.</p>
<p>Moreover, Talk can save you a great deal of time with its swift notifications. In addition to emails sent whenever someone adds a new comment or resolves a discussion, Talk now supports Workbox notifications right in your Confluence. For email fans, however, email notifications are still there. And so, you can always be in touch with your colleagues promptly responding to their comments.</p>
<p>Also, we're going to roll out the Talk interface localized for German, Spanish, and Russian speakers. If you use your Confluence in these languages, Talk Plugin installed in it won't be any different. Visit our blog, <a href="http://stiltsoft.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://stiltsoft.com/blog</a>, for news about Talk and our other products. Still don't have Talk installed? Give it a try here: <a href="http://stiltsoft.com/talk/try.html" target="_blank">http://stiltsoft.com/talk/try.html</a>.</p>
<p>Sincerely, the StiltSoft team.</p>

<h2>PlagTracker</h2>
<p>During the last couple of months, we worked really hard on our <a href="http://www.plagtracker.com/">plagiarism checker</a> and have come up with some significant improvements in the service. First we developed a new, much better version of our plagiarism detection algorithm. The algorithm now includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>check for synonyms</li>
<li>exclusion of the common phrases from text</li>
<li>use of Google, Bing and Yahoo to find duplicates and then compare the results to show the definite list of duplicate sources</li>
<li>check for misspellings, paraphrasing, and word placement changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>This algorithm is something you can't find with any similar service. At this moment, we are polishing it and it's not available for public yet, but you can take a look at it <a href="http://www.plagtracker.com/upload_new/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Also, our visitors are now able to upload documents in various extensions, such as .doc, .docx, .txt and others. Plagiarism report is also accessible for download in PDF for those who want to see a short summary of the checking process and for those who want to print it out.</p>
<p>Grammar checker is another addition to our service: people are now able to check text not only for plagiarism issues, but also for grammar errors and mistakes. To start using the grammar checker, simply upload a text into our <a href="https://www.plagtracker.com/upload/">plagiarism checker</a>, wait for the plagiarism report, and then go to Grammar Report tab button. Keep in mind that checking for plagiarism still remains our main specialization.</p>
<p>While our premium subscription option was in place long time ago, we have also noticed some of our customers need to check just one or two documents, and subscription is not something they are looking for. As a result, we have made new <a href="http://www.plagtracker.com/premium-subscription.html">premium plans</a> available:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Unlimited</b>: $14.99/month with no limit in the amount of check uploads;</li>
<li><b>Pay-per-check</b>: $1/check for those who need to check a single document or couple of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last, but not least, addition is our <a href="http://www.plagtracker.com/check-widget/">PlagTracker Widget</a>, which lets you get plagiarism reports directly from your site by inserting our widget.</p>
<p>We have tons of plans and expectations for 2013 and would like to wish you the best of luck and a flood of inspiration. Happy New Year!</p>

<h2>Southern Polytechnic State University</h2>
<p>Our Newest Course Offering: Business Analysis</p>
<p>This semester the Information Design &amp; Communication grad program at SPSU is offering a new course: <em>Business Analysis</em>. You've probably seen the term before either in the news or in job postings. However, what does a business analyst do and, more importantly, how does this position relate to technical communication?</p>
<p>For our students, this new course will introduce business analysis fundamentals, techniques and tools, with particular emphasis on communication strategies. Business analysts help “blur the lines” between technical and business goals and via strategic, communication and documentation-based activities. The documentation and communication facilitated by business analysts are an important building block to the success of rapidly moving technical projects. In 2009, Forrester reported a business analyst's ability to communicate, facilitate and analyze as fundamental to their success in that role.</p>
<p>Taught by Dr. Katie Leonard, our new course includes materials taken from industry-accepted standards, tools, texts, and case studies. Students will learn about various organizational roles that may take on business analysis duties. The course will also examine recommended career paths and the certifications. Traditional approaches, including requirements elicitation, documentation, tracking, and communication will be covered, as well as recently adapted methodologies for working in documentation-light and agile product development processes.</p>

<h2>iridize</h2>
<p><a href="https://iridize.com/" target="_blank">iridize</a> offers a unique <a href="https://iridize.com/features/" target="_blank">Point &amp; Guide tool for web sites and web applications</a>. iridize on-page guidance can be used for any instructional or training purposes, from managing simple hover tooltips, to creating <a href="https://iridize.com/how-it-works/" target="_blank">dynamic help</a> and step-by-step guides for leading users through complete flows. iridize guides are comprised of tooltips, relating a Wizard-like experience with dynamic context-sensitive content. Each step highlights the relevant screen elements, providing context and simplifying an otherwise complex verbal explanation. This feature is particularly helpful to technical writers, as it replaces the need for combining screenshots and said verbal explanations with a literally on-site instructional guide.</p>
<p>A SaaS platform applicable to any web page, iridize does not require installation. Creating, updating, and managing content does not require assistance from IT or RND resources. We believe that in today's constantly changing application landscape, technical communicators should not have to invest countless hours in training on new tools, and so iridize's fully visual editor is intuitive to use and does not require any extensive learning. So go ahead, take a short example-tour to see our <a href="https://iridize.com/training-and-help/?stStart=train1" target="_blank">web site help</a> features, read more about how to use our <a href="http://blog.iridize.com/tagged/intro" target="_blank">context sensitive help tool</a> or connect to us for more updates on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/company/iridize-ltd-?trk=hb_tab_compy_id_2722798" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/teamiridize" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://www.facebook.com/Iridize" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.</p>
