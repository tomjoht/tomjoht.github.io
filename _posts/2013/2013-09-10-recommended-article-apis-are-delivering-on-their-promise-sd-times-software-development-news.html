<p>Software Development Times has an interesting article on about APIs:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you believe a recent report from analysis firm Gartner, in just two years, we'll be overrun by citizen developers (normal, untrained computer users) building 25% of new business applications. A major facilitator for these newbies? Some have posited that cloud-based API mash-ups would be so easy to use, toddlers would soon be selling mobile apps. But now, San Francisco's hottest Platform-as-a-Service company, Salesforce (which recently acquired Heroku), is running toward developers, not away from them. And a key to success, said ProgrammableWeb founder John Musser, is the developer &mdash; not user &mdash; experience. (<a href="http://sdt.bz/37036#ixzz2e9AUOeIs">APIs are delivering on their promise - SD Times: Software Development News</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, there's definitely a trend toward more APIs, for both developers and non-developers. Both will leverage APIs to create sophisticated sites and applications. As an analogy, consider how many people use plugins with Wordpress to leverage advanced functionality for their sites. APIs are a similar step but more geared towards developers rather than end-users.</p>
<p>The article also mentions that a good API needs the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Too often, an API is passed over because its community pages are empty and support is nonexistent. Developers do want hand-holding when they use your API. That includes not only easy signup, but also guides, searchable reference materials, SDKs, pricing and clear terms of service. There has to be a community: a forum, blog, social media presence, e-mail list and an app gallery. There has to be evangelism and great support. And all of it can feed back into the API.</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm putting my bets on APIs as a mainstream trend for the future of tech. Providing documentation for APIs will be a main challenge and need. When I look at API documentation examples, the format and approach seems to vary pretty significantly.</p>
