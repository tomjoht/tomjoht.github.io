You can read it at <a href="http://techwhirl.com/dear-santa-tom-johnsons-nearly-impossible-wish-list/">Dear Santa: Tom Johnson's Nearly Impossible Wish List</a>. I'm not sure how practical it is, but I had a lot of fun making it. There are also quite a few wish lists from other tech comm people, such as Mark Baker, Kristina Halverson, Joann Hackos, Jack Molisani, and more. You can see the <a href="http://techwhirl.com/tech-writer-christmas/">full list here</a>.</p>
