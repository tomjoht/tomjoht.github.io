<p>On January 25, 2014, there's an unconference coming up in San Jose, California called <a href="http://www.tccamp.org/">TC Camp</a>. Here's the description:</p>
<blockquote><p>TC Camp is an Unconference focused on Technical Communications issues, skills, challenges, and the various applications used by technical communicators.</p>
<p>The purpose of TC Camp is to provide a local bay area conference for technical communicators that is driven by the members of that communityâ€“writers, editors, designers, and the people who support them.</p></blockquote>
<p>The conference has two parts: a morning workshop ($30) followed by spontaneous sessions (free). Users submit ideas for the sessions and then vote on which sessions they want to actually hold.</p>
