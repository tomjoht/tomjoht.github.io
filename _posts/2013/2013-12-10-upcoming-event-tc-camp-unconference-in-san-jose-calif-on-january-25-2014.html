<p>On January 25, 2014, there's an unconference coming up in San Jose, California called <a href="http://www.tccamp.org/">TC Camp</a>. Here's the description:</p>
<blockquote><p>TC Camp is an Unconference focused on Technical Communications issues, skills, challenges, and the various applications used by technical communicators.</p>
<p>The purpose of TC Camp is to provide a local bay area conference for technical communicators that is driven by the members of that community–writers, editors, designers, and the people who support them.</p></blockquote>
<p>The conference has two parts: a morning workshop ($30) followed by spontaneous sessions (free). Users submit ideas for the sessions and then vote on which sessions they want to actually hold.</p>
<p>I'm planning to attend the event. It looks like a lot of fun. Check out more details at <a href="http://www.tccamp.org">http://www.tccamp.org/</a>. The event will held at Mission College in San Jose.</p>
<p>Last year there were 150 participants. Liz Fraley of <a href="http://www.single-sourcing.com/">Single-Sourcing Solutions</a> is one of the major organizers of the event.</p>
