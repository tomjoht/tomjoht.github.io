<p>This is an audio recording of a presentation I gave at <a href="http://www.uaconference.eu">UA Europe</a> in June 2013. Here's the description:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Next to Google, YouTube is the second most popular search engine on the web. The popularity of video, especially for how-to scenarios, suggests that it should play a more prominent role in user assistance. However, creating videos poses a number of challenges. Writing a conversational script, recording professional sound, showing crisp screen images, and integrating video into your online help can be tricky. Additionally, in agile environments, video tutorials often have a short shelf-life â€” remaining current only until the next release. When you create videos, therefore, you have to create them inexpensively and quickly. At the same time, you must maintain a high quality for the visual display and sound.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Just a note: The recording is audio only. There isn't a version of the slides synced to the audio.)</p>
