<p>This is an audio recording of a presentation I gave at <a href="http://www.uaconference.eu">UA Europe</a> in June 2013. Here's the description:</p>
<blockquote><p>Users tend to search Help material when they have a specific question they're looking to answer. In contrast, users tend to browse Help material when they don't know exactly what they're looking for. Browsing often leads to better searching, and more searches often lead to better browsing, since the two activities inform each other. How can you make your content easier to find when users either search or browse for information? Answers to this question can span a range of best practices, from understanding search algorithms to including the right metadata, grouping similar topics together, adding related content, and more.</p></blockquote>
