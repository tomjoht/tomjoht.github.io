## Episode description

Here's the description of this episode:

> **WTD Episode 33: Simplified user interfaces, with Anton Bollen**
>
> One of the most challenging and frustrating things about being a tech writer is managing screenshots in your product documentation. How many times have you needed to take complex screenshots of your product and meticulously marked them up with callouts only to be told that a field has changed and you need to do everything again? It’s so frustrating and demoralizing as a writer because it feels like wasted effort. What if there was a way to create screenshots that could withstand the rapid iterations of a product under development while still conveying valuable meaning to your readers. Today we’re joined by Anton Bollen from TechSmith who explains how we can do this using low-detail screenshots, aka simplified user interfaces, that let you focus your users' attention on just the bits of the interface that matter.

## Samples

Here's a sample simplified user interface:

In this case, the shortcut commands are removed because they aren't important for the scenario.

Anton says that predictive eyetracking shows that users will focus on these unimportant areas. Removing them strengthens the focus on what matters.
