It's been about nine months since I wrote my first guest blog post on productivity and time management ([Escaping the Productivity Trap](/blog/escape-productivity-trap-david-kowalsky-guest-post)) so I feel like it is time to write again about these same topics. I'll cover the same things as last time: what I've read and my experience at applying what I learned to my own life. 

## Slow Productivity

I'll start first with the book in the [Conclusion](blog/escape-productivity-trap-david-kowalsky-guest-post#conclusion) of the guest blog post that I said I plan to read: [*Slow Productivity: The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout*](https://www.amazon.com/Slow-Productivity-Accomplishment-Without-Burnout/dp/B0CB96H3M4) by Cal Newport. In the introduction, Newport defines slow productivity as follows:

> A philosophy for organizing knowledge work efforts in a sustainable and meaningful manner, based on the following three principles (8):
> 
> 1. **Do fewer things**  
> 2. **Work at a natural pace**  
> 3. **Obsess over quality** 

The three principles seem fairly straightforward, so the logical next thing to investigate is the target audience:

> Though this book is about knowledge work productivity in general, it targets in particular anyone who has a reasonable degree of autonomy in their job. This obviously includes freelancers, solopreneurs, and those who run small businesses. (43)

This doesn't sound like a philosophy that applies well to a technical writer (or [*documentarian*](https://www.writethedocs.org/documentarians/#documentarians), the term used by Write the Docs) who is part of a writing team or one who is embedded with a team of developers. But it could still potentially apply to some technical writers, especially a lone writer at a smaller company, who I expect has more flexibility and control over their schedule and workload. I'll break down some of the strategies covered for each of the three principles and talk about my own experience.

## Do fewer things

Newport doesn't want people to make the mistake of thinking "do fewer things" is a request to "accomplish fewer things." Here's the complete definition:

> Strive to reduce your obligations to the point where you can easily imagine accomplishing them with time to spare. Leverage this reduced load to more fully embrace and advance the small number of projects that matter most. (53)

He discusses using a simple workflow for tracking projects by making a list divided into two sections: **1) holding tank**, and **2) active**. This is nearly identical to open and closed lists, which Oliver Burkeman covers in *Four Thousand Weeks* and which I wrote about last time ([Keep two to-do lists, one open and one closed](/blog/escape-productivity-trap-david-kowalsky-guest-post#two_lists)). 

Newport says to focus your attention on no more than three projects at most on the active list and update and clean the two sections once a week. 

**My experience:** I continue to make two lists in a notebook, which I started doing after reading *Four Thousand Weeks*. I'm not super rigid about feeling I have to make a new list at the start of every week. In the last few months, I've learned is that sometimes I need to stay the course with making the lists. What happens is I start writing lists on my computer, instead of writing them down in my notebook. This predictably leads to a lot of issues with two locations for lists.

I haven't been concerned with getting what I write in the notebook onto my computer and into some app for better tracking. If I ever do, I'll consider trying [Rocketbook](https://getrocketbook.com/), which is a reusable notebook that you write in and then use their app to scan each page for uploading. It seems like a better solution than taking a picture of a page with your phone.

## Work at a natural pace

A short explanation easily explains this second principle:

> Don't rush your most important work. Allow it instead to unfold along a sustainable timeline, with variations in intensity, in settings conducive to brilliance. (116)

I'll cover two of the strategies I found the most compelling: **1) Double your project timelines** and **2) create more reasonable workdays**.

**1) Double your project timelines**. This is about setting a more realistic pace with the doubling, instead of being too ambitious and then possibly having to scramble to try to hit your targets. 

**2) Create more reasonable workdays**. Some suggestions for this include reducing the number of tasks you schedule and reducing the number of appointments on your calendar.

**My experience:** I've found that over the years, as I've gained more experience working as a technical writer, along with being diligent to track resources for my projects, I've become better at estimating how long projects take. As a result, the "double your project timelines" isn't something I need to follow. But I do recognize that many projects start with an optimistic timeline and take longer to finish than originally planned.

## Obsess over quality

To be more specific about what this means, this is Newport's definition:

> Obsess over the quality of what you produce, even if this means missing opportunities in the short term. Leverage the value of these results to gain more and more freedom in our efforts over the long term. (173)

I found that this last principle wasn't very clear about outlining actual strategies. But the chapter provided a lot of real world examples. One of the best was about Newport reporting that when he was doing research for the book, he did surveys. He found "individuals who discovered that the pursuit of quality demanded simplicity" (177). A simple way to improve the quality of a team's work: limit the time the team members spent on email to only an hour or less for one session in the morning and one in the afternoon or evening. Along with this, have the team observe a three-hour deep-work period during the day with no meetings.

**My experience:** I recognized some variation of this principle (obsess over quality) being included at one time as official company behavior at a company I used to work for. So it's a real world thing and can contribute to positive results for the company. If you're interested in exploring company behaviors (usually along with company values), sometimes they're included on a careers web page about the culture of a company.

## Meditations for Mortals

Ezra Klein's first podcast episode of 2025, [Burned Out? Stay Here](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/burned-out-start-here/id1548604447?i=1000682997984), is about his need to work through having what he calls "a pretty bad case of burnout" at the end of last year. He turned to Oliver Burkeman's newest book ([*Meditations for Mortals: Four Weeks to Embrace Your Limitations and Make Time for What Count*](https://www.amazon.com/Meditations-Mortals-Embrace-Limitations-Counts/dp/0374611998/) (Farrar, Straus and Giroux). This book, published in October of 2024, only three years after *Four Thousand Weeks,* isn't one of those follow-up workbooks to get more money from a best-selling idea. Burkeman challenges the conventional pursuit of perfection and control, suggesting that our relentless drive for super-productivity often leads to anxiety and burnout. Just like *Four Thousand Weeks,* Burkeman firmly believes no productivity system will master a system of control.

*Meditations for Mortals* is divided into four sections: "Being Finite," "Taking Action," "Letting Go," and "Showing Up." Each section contains seven chapters, with each chapter serving as a daily meditation, asking you to reconsider what truly matters and how to engage more fully with the present moment. The chapters are short, five or six pages at most, so it's easy to proceed at the recommended pace of one chapter per day. The two chapters I liked best were "Day Four: Against Productivity Debt" and "Day Thirteen: Three Hours."

## Day Four: Against Productivity Debt

Burkeman introduces the concept of productivity debt, which is about starting off the day with an endless list of tasks to finish, the debt. To be productive, by the end of the day you need to complete all of the tasks to get back to a zero balance. Then it starts all over again the next day. It can be an even bigger thing than just the tasks; it can go as far as being about trying to justify your existence. Burkeman does offer a way to combat productivity debt: keep a done list. I wrote about this in the first guest blog post: [Keep a done list](/blog/escape-productivity-trap-david-kowalsky-guest-post#done_list). Start the day with an empty list. Add to the list what you've accomplished.

**My experience:** I still continue to make a done list. A newer thing I've been experimenting with to force me away from *daily* productivity debt is to think in terms of what I want to accomplish by the end of the week. I don't put so much pressure on each day. For example, I may have a bunch of email to reply to and new messages to write that are not super urgent, so they can wait until Friday. This way earlier in the week I will focus on higher priority tasks.

**Day Thirteen: Three Hours**

In this chapter, Burkeman introduces the three-to-four-hour rule for getting creative work done. He breaks it down into two parts:

> The first is to try &mdash; to whatever degree your situation permits &mdash; to timebox a three- or four-hour period each day, free from appointments or interruptions. The equally important second part is not to worry about imposing much order on the rest of the day; to accept that your other hours will probably be characterized by the usual fragmentary chaos of life. (72)

The 3-4 hour range comes from looking at historical accounts of the daily routines of artists, authors, scientists, composers, and others. Burkeman points readers to Alex Soojung-Kim Pang's book [*Rest: Why You Get More Done When You Work Less*](https://www.amazon.com/Rest-More-Done-When-Work/dp/0465074871/) (Basic Books) to go beyond providing the examples, but also assembling the research that helps explain why:

> ...because intense focus uses up energy; because it's more effective to focus intensely during only your peak hours, rather than half-heartedly all day, and because creativity appears to depend partly on processes taking place in your brain while you're *not* focusing. (71)

**My experience:** My own experimenting with the three-to-four-hour rule has been great when it comes to working on extra projects. I'm more realistic about allotting time to work on them. And I'm more productive because I know when to stop, instead of going through the motions to continue working when my interest level declines.

## Conclusion

At first, it was easy to be dismissive about *Slow Productivity* because it arguably isn't the best book for applying to the work of a technical writer. However, I'm glad I stuck with it and found it worthwhile enough to devote much of this post to it. The format of Oliver Burkeman's two books are very different: *Meditations for Mortals* has very short chapters, but takes more work to find the tips to apply to your own situation. *Four Thousand Weeks* takes longer to read, but has more depth and even an appendix with a list of ten tools.

As I continue to experiment with what I've learned, I keep finding new productivity and time management tools and topics to read about and try. Here’s my current list:

* **Timeboxing**
