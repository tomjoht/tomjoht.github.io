description: "I'm starting an book club called <i>AI Book Club: A Human in the Loop</i>. As you might expect, the book club involves reading and discussing books about AI on a regular basis. The book club will meet online, currently planned for the third Sunday of each month at 10 am Pacific Time (Seattle's time zone). There are some async chat options through Slack as well, and we'll record the meetings. Check it out at <a href='https://idratherbewriting.com/ai-book-club'>AI Book Club: A Human in the Loop</a>. If you've been looking to read more (or get back into reading) while also increasing your understanding of AI, this club could be a good fit."
