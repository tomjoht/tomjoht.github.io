description: "In my prompt engineering series, I added an article exploring how API quick reference guides (QRGs) can improve developer usability and also augment AI chat sessions with much-needed context. These QRGs are structured as hierarchical tree diagrams providing a visual map to complex APIs. The diagrams make it easier for developers to navigate and understand relationships between elements compared to traditional flat reference documentation. The article also includes a step-by-step process for creating these QRGs using AI."
