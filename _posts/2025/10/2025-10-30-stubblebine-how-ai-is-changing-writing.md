Tony Stubblebine is the CEO of [Medium.com](Medium.com), which is a popular platform for people to write content. Personally, I’ve never been a huge fan of Medium because it presents a paywall to read the content. Additionally, many Medium authors seem invisible to me as real people, so I’ve always been a bit suspicious of the platform. However, listening to Stubblemine on this episode changed my mind a bit. Stubblebine is smart and insightful, and some of his points resonated with me. 

Stubblebine and Kantrowitz talk generally about AI slop and how sites like Medium can avoid promoting it, as well as how to avoid the general de-incentivization of writing on the internet.

Stubblebine argues that writing is about thinking, and smart people like to think. So writing isn’t going away because of AI. As long as there are smart people who like to think, they’ll continue to write. 

Stubblebine’s point about writing as a tool for thinking is one John Warner drives home in his book *[More Than Words: How to think about writing in the Age of AI](https://idratherbewriting.com/blog/jonathan-warner-more-than-words-book-review)* (a book we read in the [AI book club](https://idratherbewriting.com/ai-book-club), with a [recording here](https://idratherbewriting.com/blog/warner-book-more-than-words-notes)). I agree 100% about writing as a mode of thinking, which is why I’ve sort of abandoned many attempts to use AI in writing blog posts.

Kantrowitz agrees that it’s often when you sit down to write that you realize you don’t fully understand a topic. Writing forces you to sort and organize the thoughts in your mind in a way that requires clarity, and this often prompts you to review or re-investigate the subject to make sure you understand it. 

Stubblebine argues that there’s great value in people sharing experiences from their lives in posts on the Internet. He doesn’t want AI companies to undermine that sharing. He says that for most people, the motivation to write was never for monetary reasons, so even if AI companies paid writers to train on their content, the payment wouldn’t solve the problem. Most of the writers do value readers, and AI sites are threatening to upend readership. 

Stubblebine says Google’s great invention with the Internet was to allow anyone to start writing about a topic, and find readers through traffic to your site. But now with AI chat, many of the readers never fully go to your site; they find information from the AI interaction itself. He said the funnel is something like 1 to 100 in terms of people making it to Medium.com.

Stubblebine even argues that Medium provides so much content to AI companies, they have the potential to poison the well if they wanted. He claimed that the emphasis on em dashes, a favorite of an early Medium leader, is why AI tools overuse em dashes. He also talked about partnering with Cloudflare in terms of organizing resistance to content being used to train AI models. 

Despite the threats AI poses to leadership, Stubblebine isn’t against using AI as a tool in the writing process. He sees AI as a “second brain” tool, similar to the personal knowledge management tools like Notion or Evernote where people store notes as a kind of externalized brain that they can query and access as they write. For example, in writing this post, I might want to quote from Warner’s book. I can’t remember those quotes or what might be relevant, but a second-brain AI that holds everything I’ve ever written might be useful to me here. 

I like the idea of using AI tools as a second brain for writing, essentially assigning their role as a research assistant rather than the one steering and generating the content. I once tried putting my entire blog into a Gemini gem but quickly found that it’s difficult to do that. I have millions of words on this site from nearly 20 years of blogging.

Stubblebine also welcomes other supporting uses of AI, such as ensuring accuracy or for summarization, but acknowledged that there’s a gray area between some use of AI and too much use of AI. 

Overall, the podcast made me reflect on the strange division between blogging and writing documentation. For this personal blog, writing is a tool for thinking and so I don’t use AI tools as much here. But for work, writing tech docs seems to tap into some other non-creative area of the brain, where using AI to generate content is fine and even preferable. People aren’t interested in seeing a Descartes-like mind thinking through an idea. They want a clear description of what data an API field provides, for example. It’s always been difficult to reconcile these two facets of writing.
