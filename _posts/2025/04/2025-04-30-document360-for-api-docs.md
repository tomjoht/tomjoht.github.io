description: "I recently added <a href='/learnapidoc/pubapis_document360.html'>Document360 for API docs</a> to my <a href='/learnapidoc/restapispecifications.html'>Chapter 4: OpenAPI spec and generated reference docs</a> in my API doc site. Document360 lets you publish API reference documentation from OpenAPI specification files. Importantly, it lets you integrate this API reference content smoothly with your broader knowledge base and regular documentation, all within a single portal. The platform supports various import methods for OpenAPI files (versions 3.1, 3.0, 2.0) and Postman Collections, focusing on the publishing aspect rather than OpenAPI authoring (which I feel is a smart move to avoid unnecessary UI complexity)."

In my article, I highlight several examples of API documentation sites built with Document360, showcasing its modern, quick, and user-friendly interface. Some features I highlight include a snappy, fast-loading experience, clear hierarchical organization of API endpoints in the sidebar, excellent parameter readability through collapse/expand toggles and tree diagrams, and an effective tri-column layout incorporating a "Try-it" pane and code examples. 

Overall, [Document360](https://document360.com/) leverages established API documentation best practices, providing an intuitive experience for developers and allowing authors to concentrate on content quality over tool configuration.
