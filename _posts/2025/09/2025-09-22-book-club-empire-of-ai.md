For more details about the book club and schedule, see [AI Book Club: A human in the loop](/ai-book-club). Everyone is welcome to participate.

The [notes and discussion questions doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tAqsTZn7w9Dgti1KGj9g-poj33uwhXngDTagBnY0TuY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9fjjlshp70zh) provides some questions to help prime the discussion, but honestly we rarely follow the questions there.

For this club discussion, I prepared a [NotebookLM notebook](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/876effa1-eb6e-497c-9361-b1439ec6351d), which compiles around 20 sources This notebook has a lot of sources compiled and various video overviews generated from the sources. I added a variety of sources to try to balance out the arguments and also look more carefully at the empire comparisons.
