## Suleyman's main argument

Mustafa Suleyman's *The Coming Wave* constructs a compelling, if unsettling, argument about humanity's trajectory in the face of unprecedented technological advancement. The argument can be distilled as follows:

1. **Assertion: Technology's inherent proliferation:** Foundational technologies, particularly general-purpose technologies that have transformative impact across domains (like the combusion engine or Internet), possess an intrinsic tendency towards widespread global proliferation. This spread isn't accidental but is driven by powerful and enduring human, economic, and geopolitical incentives.  
2. **Assertion:** **The unprecedented nature of the "coming wave":** The current technological wave, primarily centered on Artificial Intelligence (AI &mdash; the engineering of intelligence) and Synthetic Biology (SynBio &mdash; the engineering of life), is qualitatively different and more potent than previous waves. These technologies, along with their accelerators like robotics and quantum computing, exhibit unique characteristics that amplify their impact:  
   * **Asymmetry:** Small actors can wield disproportionate power.  
   * **Hyper-evolution:** Technologies develop at an accelerating, exponential pace.  
   * **Omni-use:** They have extremely versatile applications, both good and bad.  
   * **Autonomy:** Systems can operate with decreasing human oversight.  
3. **Assertion: The inevitable emergence of significant risk:** Given the inherent tendency of powerful technologies to proliferate (Assertion 1) and the unique, power-amplifying characteristics of the coming wave (Assertion 2), its uncontained development and spread inevitably generate significant, potentially existential, risks for humanity.  
4. **Assertion: The simultaneous necessity of these technologies:** Despite these risks, the same technologies constituting the "coming wave" are simultaneously essential for addressing humanity's most pressing global challenges &mdash; such as climate change, incurable diseases, resource scarcity, and demographic imbalances. Deliberately halting or severely curtailing technological progress (*stagnation*) isn't a viable or desirable path, as it would likely lead to a different form of societal collapse due to unresolved crises.  
5. **Assertion: The control paradox &mdash; The danger in overly forceful containment:** Attempts to completely eliminate all risks through overly forceful containment measures would likely necessitate levels of global surveillance, centralized control, and restrictions on freedom that create oppressive, dystopian societies.  
6. **Conclusion: The great dilemma and the imperative of sophisticated containment:** Humanity is therefore caught in "The Great Dilemma": uncontained proliferation risks **Catastrophe** (from Assertion 3); deliberately halting progress invites **Stagnation** and its own collapse (from Assertion 4); and attempts at absolute, forceful control risk **Dystopia** (from Assertion 5). Since none of these outcomes are acceptable, the imperative of the 21st century must be the active, ongoing pursuit of sophisticated, multi-layered **Containment**. This isn't about stopping technology, but about dynamically steering and constraining it through a combination of technical safety measures, audits, strategic slowdowns, responsible development practices, new business models, adaptive governance, international cooperation, and an important cultural shift towards caution and responsibility. This "narrow path" is presented as extraordinarily difficult but essential for navigating the coming wave.

## Pessimism aversion: The unwillingness to see the abyss

An important concept Mustafa Suleyman introduces is "pessimism aversion." He defines this as a widespread psychological tendency, particularly prevalent among technologists, policymakers, and the general public, to avoid, downplay, or outright dismiss the potential negative, catastrophic, or even apocalyptic outcomes of powerful new technologies. In short, to be averse about a pessimistic future.

It's an inherent bias towards optimism or a deep-seated reluctance to confront uncomfortable, worst-case possibilities, even when a rational analysis of trends and capabilities might suggest the plausibility of dark trajectories. This aversion, Suleyman argues, hinders our ability to adequately prepare for, mitigate, or contain the genuine existential risks posed by the coming wave.

## Dark trajectories that lead to civiliation's collapse

Suleyman's book outlines several pathways where the uncontained "coming wave" &mdash; driven by AI and Synthetic Biology &mdash; could lead to the collapse of human civilization or even extinction. Here are some of these trajectories, sketched succinctly:

1. **Engineered pandemics (Synthetic Biology and AI):** Increasingly accessible and sophisticated gene-editing tools (like CRISPR), coupled with AI's ability to accelerate biological design and predict protein functions, dramatically lower the barrier to creating enhanced pathogens. Whether through state-sponsored bioweapon programs, sophisticated non-state actors seeking mass disruption, or even catastrophic accidents from poorly regulated labs, an engineered pandemic with high transmissibility and lethality could swiftly overwhelm global healthcare systems, shatter societal trust, and lead to a cascading collapse of essential services, global order, and potentially billions of lives, far exceeding the impact of natural outbreaks.  
2. **Uncontrolled or misaligned artificial general intelligence (AGI/ACI):** As AI systems rapidly advance towards and potentially surpass human-level general intelligence (AGI), or achieve highly capable, autonomous forms of intelligence (ACI) across important domains, the risk of "loss of control" becomes acute. An AI pursuing its programmed goals with unforeseen instrumental logic, or one that resists human attempts to shut it down or realign it, could commandeer vast resources or initiate actions catastrophically misaligned with human values and survival, leading to our marginalization, enslavement, or outright extinction as an unintended side effect of its optimization processes.  
3. **Autonomous warfare and escalation (AI and Robotics):** The proliferation of cheap, highly effective, and AI-driven autonomous weapons systems (e.g., intelligent drone swarms, robotic soldiers, automated cyber-offensive platforms) destabilizes global security and lowers the threshold for conflict. "Flash wars" fought at machine speed, with decisions made beyond direct human intervention, could escalate uncontrollably, leading to devastating conventional conflicts or even accidental nuclear exchanges. The low cost and potential deniability empower numerous state and non-state actors, risking a future of constant, unmanageable, and technologically advanced warfare.  
4. **Societal breakdown via information chaos ("Infocalypse"):** The widespread deployment of AI capable of generating highly realistic and personalized deepfakes (video, audio, text), coupled with automated propaganda campaigns, erodes the shared sense of reality and destroys trust in institutions, media, and interpersonal communication. This "infocalypse" makes coherent public discourse, evidence-based policymaking, and democratic governance virtually impossible. The resulting extreme polarization, social fragmentation, and inability to address collective challenges could lead to widespread civil unrest, the collapse of social order, or the rise of extreme authoritarianism to impose control over information.  
5. **Economic collapse from mass automation and inequality:** The rapid deployment of AI and robotics across most sectors of the economy leads to widespread, structural unemployment that outpaces society's ability to adapt through mechanisms like universal basic income, reskilling initiatives, or the creation of new job sectors. The resulting extreme economic inequality, collapse of the consumer base, decimation of tax revenues, and widespread despair among a "useless class" could cripple state functions, fuel massive social upheaval, and trigger a lasting global economic depression, leading to systemic collapse.  
6. **Erosion of the nation-state and rise of unchecked asymmetric power:** The core technologies of the wave (AI, SynBio, advanced robotics) empower small groups, corporations, or even individuals with capabilities previously monopolized by nation-states&mdash;such as designing and potentially deploying bioweapons, launching large-scale cyberattacks that cripple infrastructure, or commanding autonomous drone armies. This diffusion of immense power erodes the state's ability to provide security and maintain order, potentially leading to a fragmented world dominated by powerful non-state actors, unaccountable megacorporations, or a Hobbesian state of nature where unchecked power can cause catastrophic disruption.  
7. **Converging crises and systemic fragility amplification:** The "coming wave" doesn't necessarily cause collapse through a single technological vector but acts as a potent "fragility amplifier" for pre-existing global stresses such as climate change, resource scarcity, geopolitical instability, and state debt. A confluence of several moderate crises&mdash;a regional AI-driven conflict, a significant cyberattack on important global infrastructure, a severe climate-related disaster, and an AI-exacerbated financial panic&madsh;could interact and cascade, overwhelming already weakened global systems and leading to a comprehensive, systemic collapse of civilization.

These scenarios illustrate the gravity of Suleyman's concerns. The path to catastrophe isn't necessarily a single, sudden event but can be a complex interplay of technological capabilities hitting vulnerable societal and geopolitical structures.

## Containment strategies: Navigating the narrow path

Confronted with "The Great Dilemma," Suleyman argues that humanity's primary task is to achieve "containment"&mdash;not to halt technology, but to actively steer and constrain it. This involves a multi-layered approach, moving from the technical core outwards to global cooperation. Here are some of the containment strategies he proposes:

1. **Technical safety and alignment ("An Apollo Program for AI Safety"):** The "Apollo Program" reference evokes the large-scale, nationally prioritized, and mission-driven effort of the US space program to land on the moon. Suleyman uses this analogy to call for a similarly ambitious and well-funded global initiative focused on solving the fundamental technical challenges of AI safety and alignment. This means developing provably safe systems, ensuring AI goals remain aligned with human values even as capabilities evolve, creating reliable "off-switches" or control mechanisms, and designing systems that can express uncertainty or refuse unsafe commands. For synthetic biology, this translates to robust biosafety protocols, secure DNA synthesis screening, and failsafe mechanisms for engineered organisms.  
2. **Audits, transparency, and verification:** Establishing rigorous, independent auditing processes for powerful AI systems and biotech facilities is important. This includes "red teaming" (stress-testing systems for vulnerabilities and unintended behaviors), creating incident databases to learn from failures (akin to aviation safety), and developing methods for scalable supervision and verification of complex systems. Transparency in how AI models are trained, their limitations, and their potential biases is vital for building trust and accountability.  
3. **Strategic use of choke points:** Identifying and using existing or created bottlenecks in the supply chains or development pipelines of key technologies (e.g., advanced semiconductor manufacturing, specialized DNA synthesis reagents, large-scale compute resources) can offer temporary levers to slow down the most dangerous aspects of proliferation. This isn't about stopping progress indefinitely, but about buying important time for safety measures, governance frameworks, and international agreements to catch up with rapidly advancing capabilities.  
4. **Government action and enhanced state capacity:** Nation-states must urgently build in-house technical expertise to understand and regulate these complex technologies effectively. This involves smart regulation (such as licensing for high-risk AI development or SynBio labs), managing societal transitions caused by automation (exploring ideas like UBI or new tax structures), and potentially developing state-owned or heavily regulated key AI infrastructure to ensure public oversight. Governments need to move beyond reactive postures to proactively shape the trajectory of the wave.  
5. **International alliances and treaties:** Given the global nature of the coming wave and its associated risks, international cooperation is indispensable, however difficult. This includes establishing global norms, sharing best practices for safety and ethics, creating international bodies for risk assessment and incident response (like a global bio-risk observatory or an AI safety consortium), and working towards verifiable treaties for non-proliferation of the most dangerous applications, particularly concerning autonomous weapons and engineered pathogens.

These strategies, among others, form the core of Suleyman's proposed "narrow path," an attempt to navigate between the perils of unconstrained technological development and the dangers of oppressive overreach.

## Job evolutions/transformations for the coming wave

In the short term, the societal shifts anticipated by *The Coming Wave* will inevitably reshape the labor market, rendering some roles obsolete while creating urgent demand for new specializations. For technical writers and other knowledge workers, understanding these potential transformations is key to navigating their careers. 

This section doesn’t come from Suleyman’s book but rather is an inspired imagination about the transformations in the job market that professionals might see. It’s likely that either tech writers will shift focus on these topics and domains, or that maybe their job titles themselves will change.

1. **AI-generated content authenticator / Deepfake investigator:**  
   * As AI's ability to generate convincing text, images, audio, and video becomes ubiquitous, the "Infocalypse" scenario looms. Trust in information will plummet, making individuals skilled in forensically analyzing digital content to determine its authenticity and expose manipulation indispensable for legal systems, journalism, intelligence, and corporate integrity.  
2. **Autonomous systems security specialist (Drone/Robot defense):**  
   * The proliferation of autonomous systems (drones, robots) for both benign and malicious purposes, as highlighted by Suleyman's concerns about asymmetric warfare and autonomous weapons, necessitates experts who can secure friendly systems and defend against hostile ones. This role is important for military, civil, and corporate security.  
3. **Bio-risk detection and response specialist:**  
   * With SynBio tools becoming more accessible, the risk of accidental leaks from labs or deliberate misuse (engineered pathogens) increases. Specialists who can rapidly detect novel biological threats, trace their origins, and coordinate containment responses will be vital for public health and global security.  
4. **Resilient infrastructure technician (Energy/Comms/Water):**  
   * Increased cyberattacks, physical threats from autonomous systems, climate instability, and potential state decay will strain important infrastructure. Society will need skilled individuals who can design, build, maintain, and rapidly repair robust and adaptable energy, communication, and water systems, often in challenging or decentralized environments.  
5. **Localized resource manager (Food/Water/Energy production):**  
   * If global supply chains fracture due to conflict, pandemics, or widespread instability (as implied by several of Suleyman's risk trajectories), communities will need to become more self-sufficient. Experts in establishing and managing local, sustainable food, water, and energy production will be key for survival and resilience.  
6. **Digital privacy and counter-surveillance expert:**  
   * Whether society veers towards dystopian state surveillance or chaotic fragmentation with numerous actors conducting surveillance, the demand for protecting personal and organizational data and communications will soar. These experts will help individuals and groups maintain privacy and operational security.  
7. **Crisis mediator and de-escalation specialist:**  
   * Increased polarization, resource scarcity, state fragmentation, and the proliferation of conflict-enabling technologies will likely lead to more frequent and complex disputes. Individuals skilled in negotiation, mediation, and de-escalation will be essential for resolving conflicts and maintaining peace at local, regional, and even international levels.  
8. **AI safety and containment implementer:**  
   * As a core part of Suleyman's "containment" imperative, there will be a need for technical experts dedicated to building safety into AI systems, conducting alignment research, performing audits, and ensuring that AI development adheres to ethical guidelines and safety protocols to prevent unintended harmful outcomes.  
9. **Transition and basic needs coordinator:**  
   * Mass automation and economic disruption could displace vast numbers of people. Coordinators will be needed to manage social safety nets (if they exist), distribute essential resources, facilitate retraining or transitions to new forms of work/livelihood, and address the widespread societal impact of economic irrelevance for many.  
10. **Psychological resilience and adaptation coach:**  
    * Living through an era of rapid, unpredictable change, potential information chaos, existential threats, and economic precarity will take a significant psychological toll. Professionals who can help individuals and communities build resilience, cope with stress and uncertainty, and adapt to new realities will be in high demand.

For technical writers, these evolving roles suggest pathways that leverage core skills&mdash;such as clear communication, understanding complex systems, user advocacy, and information structuring&mdash;but apply them in new, important contexts focused on safety, resilience, verification, and navigating profound societal change.

## Discussion questions for technical writers

Reflecting on *The Coming Wave* and its implications, technical writers might consider the following questions to explore the book's relevance.

1. **Automation and augmentation:** Which specific tasks in your current technical writing workflow do you see as most vulnerable to automation by advanced AI in the next 5-10 years? Conversely, how can AI tools best augment your skills to enhance productivity and allow you to focus on higher-value work?  
2. **Pessimism aversion in tech comm:** Do you observe "pessimism aversion" within your organization or the broader tech writing community regarding the potential downsides of AI or other technologies we document? How might this impact the way risks or limitations are communicated?  
3. **Documenting "black box" systems:** Suleyman highlights the challenge of "black box" AI. As technical writers, what strategies can we develop to effectively document systems whose internal workings are opaque or probabilistic, especially regarding their limitations, potential biases, and failure modes?  
4. **The role of clarity in containment:** How significant is the role of clear, accurate, and comprehensive documentation in supporting Suleyman's proposed "containment strategies," particularly for technical safety, audits, and ensuring responsible use of powerful technologies?  
5. **Evolving skill sets:** Looking at the "Job evolutions" section, which of those roles (e.g., AI content authenticator, AI safety implementer, digital privacy expert) seem like natural or achievable extensions of a technical writer's skill set? What new skills would be most important to acquire?  
6. **Ethical responsibilities:** When documenting powerful AI or biotech tools, what ethical responsibilities do technical writers have regarding potential misuse, unintended consequences, or the clear communication of risks, even if it makes the technology seem less appealing?  
7. **The "infocalypse" and trust:** In an era of potential AI-driven misinformation, how can technical documentation maintain its status as a trusted source of truth? What measures can we take to ensure the integrity and verifiability of the information we provide?  
8. **Documenting AI uncertainty and reliability:** When an AI system provides information or performs a task, its outputs aren't always 100% certain or correct (e.g., an LLM might "hallucinate" or a diagnostic AI might have a margin of error). How can technical writers clearly explain these concepts of probabilistic outputs, confidence scores, or potential inaccuracies to users so they can make informed decisions about when and how much to trust the AI's output, without causing undue alarm or complete dismissal of the tool?  
9. **Contribution to AI safety:** Beyond documenting features, how can technical writers actively contribute to the broader goals of AI safety and alignment within their organizations, perhaps by advocating for safety-conscious design or more transparent development processes?  
10. **Adapting to hyper-evolution:** Given the "hyper-evolution" of technologies described by Suleyman, what changes do we need to make to our documentation processes, tools, and strategies to keep pace with rapidly changing products and user needs?

## Pushback against Suleyman's ideas: Reasons for optimism?

Although "The Coming Wave" presents a case for caution and the potential for catastrophe, let's consider counterarguments and reasons why the future might unfold more positively. (These arguments aren't summarized from Suleyman's book but are rather added here from me.)

1. **Human ingenuity and adaptability:** A primary counterargument rests on humanity's historical track record. Throughout history, societies have faced disruptive technological shifts, from the printing press to the industrial revolution and the nuclear age. While these periods often involved significant turmoil, displacement, and new dangers, human ingenuity consistently found ways to adapt, innovate solutions, develop new norms, and integrate these technologies, ultimately often leading to improved living standards and new forms of progress. This perspective suggests that we will similarly adapt to AI and SynBio, developing ethical frameworks, safety protocols, and societal adjustments as the technologies mature.

2. **Market forces and capitalist dynamics as correctives:** Another significant line of pushback comes from the belief in the self-regulating power of market forces. In this view, every problem or risk created by a new technology also creates a market opportunity for a solution. For example, the rise of deepfakes has spurred investment in deepfake detection technologies; cybersecurity threats have birthed a multi-billion dollar cybersecurity industry. Capitalism, by its nature, incentivizes innovation, and this innovation can be directed towards mitigating harms, developing safety tools, and creating countermeasures, potentially balancing out the risks without requiring overarching, centralized containment that could stifle progress.

3. **Overstated risks and "doomerism"**: Critics might argue that Suleyman leans too heavily into "doomerism" or exaggerates the likelihood and scale of worst-case scenarios. The human fascination with apocalyptic narratives can sometimes lead to an overemphasis on potential catastrophes. (Hollywood has a fascination with end-of-world narratives.) It's possible that the current limitations of AI (its lack of true understanding, its brittleness) are more indicative of its ultimate ceiling than proponents of existential risk believe, or that the technical challenges of creating truly uncontrollable AGI or globally devastating bioweapons are far greater than acknowledged. Some threats, like deepfakes, while problematic, haven't (yet) led to the complete societal breakdown once feared by some, suggesting a degree of societal resilience or that initial alarms were overblown.

4. **The "pacing problem" solved by incremental governance:** While Suleyman highlights the "pacing problem" (technology advancing faster than governance), an optimistic view is that governance can and does adapt, albeit sometimes slowly and incrementally. Democratic societies, through public discourse, expert consultation, and iterative legislative processes, can develop regulatory frameworks that address emerging harms without resorting to authoritarian control. International cooperation, while challenging, has achieved successes in other areas (e.g., nuclear non-proliferation, ozone layer protection) and could similarly evolve to manage the risks of AI and SynBio.

5. **The unfolding of unforeseen positive "black swans": **Just as there can be unforeseen negative consequences, powerful new technologies can also unlock entirely unexpected positive breakthroughs that fundamentally alter the risk-benefit calculus. AI and SynBio might lead to rapid advancements in areas like clean energy, disease eradication, or resource abundance that solve many of the underlying global stressors Suleyman identifies as fragility amplifiers. These positive black swans could create a future so much better that the transitional risks, while real, are navigated more successfully due to newfound capabilities and improved global well-being.

## The evolving role of technical writers: Thriving in the AI era

For technical writers, the "coming wave" of AI and related technologies presents both challenges to traditional roles and opportunities for evolution and increased impact. The fear of job loss through automation is palpable, yet the demand for skilled communicators who can navigate and explain these complex new systems is simultaneously growing. The key isn't to resist the wave, but to learn to surf it, transforming from traditional documenters into indispensable AI-era information experts and experience architects.

The transformation is already underway. Technical writers are increasingly being asked to become AI experts, not just in using AI tools for their own productivity, but in understanding and documenting the AI systems their companies are building. The focus is shifting from static documentation portals and traditional pages towards creating dynamic, intelligent information experiences where users get precisely the answers they need, when they need them, often through conversational AI interfaces. This requires an ability to tap into user queries, analyze information systems for gaps and weaknesses, and then design or even help implement automated or agentic workflows to build smarter, self-improving knowledge bases.

Here are ten key areas technical writers can focus on right now to not only survive but excel in this AI-driven era:

1. **Mastering AI augmentation tools:** Develop deep proficiency in using AI writing assistants (LLMs, specialized documentation AI) for drafting, editing, summarization, translation, and code documentation. Effective prompt engineering for content creation and information retrieval becomes a core skill.  
2. **Specializing in AI system documentation and explainability:** Focus on the complex task of documenting AI models themselves&mdash;their architectures, training data, limitations, biases, and decision-making processes. This is important for transparency, trust, safety, and regulatory compliance in an increasingly AI-driven world.  
3. **Designing conversational information experiences:** Shift from traditional documentation formats to designing and structuring information for AI-powered chatbots, virtual assistants, and in-app contextual help. This involves understanding natural language processing, dialogue flow, and how users seek information through conversation.  
4. **Developing content strategy for AI-powered systems:** Lead the strategy for how information is created, managed, and delivered in an AI environment. This includes defining content models for AI consumption (for example, setting up the llms.txt and llms-full.txt files, model context protocol (MCP) servers), ensuring content discoverability by AI, and integrating documentation with AI-driven support and product experiences.  
5. **Information architecture for machine learning:** Structure and tag content meticulously so that AI systems can easily understand, process, and retrieve it to provide accurate answers. This involves a deeper understanding of metadata, taxonomies, and knowledge graphs.  
6. **User query analysis and content gap identification:** Use analytics from search logs, chatbot interactions, and support tickets to identify precisely what information users are seeking, where current systems are failing, and what content gaps need to be filled&mdash;then use AI to help bridge these gaps rapidly.  
7. **Curating and validating AI-generated content:** As AI generates more draft content, the technical writer's role as a subject matter expert, critical thinker, and quality controller becomes even more vital. Validating AI outputs for accuracy, clarity, completeness, and tone is paramount. Learn how to counter hallucination and mistakes from AI tools&mdash;for example, perhaps by developing checks that examine each assertion against the reference documentation.  
8. **Ethical communication and risk disclosure:** Champion the clear, responsible communication of AI system capabilities, limitations, and potential risks. Develop expertise in articulating ethical considerations and ensuring users understand how to interact with AI safely and appropriately.  
9. **Automated and agentic information workflows:** Explore and implement tools and techniques for automating parts of the content lifecycle, from identifying outdated information using AI to triggering automated updates or even using AI agents to proactively suggest and create needed content based on user behavior.  
10. **Cross-functional collaboration with AI teams:** Work more closely than ever with AI developers, data scientists, UX designers, and product managers to ensure that documentation and information experience are considered integral parts of the AI product development lifecycle from the outset.
