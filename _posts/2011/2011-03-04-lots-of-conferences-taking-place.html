<p>Have you noticed how many good conferences are scheduled lately? I remember a couple of years ago, when Doc Train conferences ended, and some of us thought the STC Summit was approaching its last time -- I thought conferences would become extinct. Today there are almost too many conferences. Here are some of the interesting looking conferences taking place within the next couple of months:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="SXSW Interactive" href="http://sxsw.com/interactive">SXSW Interactive </a>-- March 11-15, Austin, Tex.</li>
<li><a title="WritersUA Conference" href="http://www.writersua.com/conference/">WritersUA</a> -- March 13-16, Long Beach, Calif.</li>
<li><a title="Information Architecture Summit" href="http://2011.iasummit.org/">IA Summit </a>-- March 30 - April 3, Denver, Colo.</li>
<li><a title="Confab Content Strategy Conference 2011" href="http://confab2011.com/">Confab (Content Strategy) </a>-- May 9-11, Minneapolis, Minn.</li>
<li><a title="STC Summit" href="http://summit.stc.org">STC Summit</a> -- May 15-18, Sacramento, Calif.</li>
<li><a title="Congility (formerly X-Pubs)" href="http://www.congility.com/">Congility</a> -- May 24-26, Gatwick, UK</li>
<li><a title="Web Content 2011" href="http://www.webcontent2011.com/">Web Content 2011</a> -- June 6-7, Chicago, Ill.</li>
</ul>

<p>Last month the <a title="Intelligent Content" href="http://www.rockley.com/IC2011/">Intelligent Content</a> conference took place. It seems that the number of conferences are growing. The only conference I'm planning to attend during the next three months, however, is the STC Summit. But that's only due to time and budget. The Content Strategy conference actually looks really appealing.</p>
