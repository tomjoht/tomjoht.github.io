<p>Donna Spencer is the author of <a href="http://practical-ia.com/">A Practical Guide to Information Architecture</a> as well as two other books (on card sorting and writing for the web). She's an experienced information architect, based in Australia, who gives regular <a href="http://maadmob.com.au/workshops/information-architecture-iasummit">workshops on information architecture</a> at conferences such as the <a href="http://2011.iasummit.org/">IA Summit</a> and also runs the <a href="http://www.uxaustralia.com.au/">UX Australia conference</a>. In this podcast we talk about information architecture, especially in the context of technical communication. Some of the topics we cover include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What information architecture is, especially in contrast to content strategy and user experience</li>
<li>Why writers are well suited for information architecture</li>
<li>Reasons for doing user research prior to building your information architecture</li>
<li>Determining user terminology (and dangers of choosing the wrong terms, even if people use them)</li>
<li>Evaluating browse versus search, and the problem of looking for information without knowing the right terms</li>
<li>Strategies for dealing with overlapping categories and difficult-to-fit topics</li>
<li>Why organizing content by audience can be tricky</li>
<li>Using focused entry points to serve different audiences</li>
<li>Finding what you need when you don't know what you need</li>
<li>Organizing content by popularity, and other alternative classification schemes</li>
<li>Scenario driven testing with index cards</li>
<li>Card sorting strategies, tools, and limits</li>
<li>Reasons for brainstorming IA off-screen, without your computer.</li>
<li>Determining the number of top-level navigation options</li>
<li>Providing navigation through next and related links</li>
<li>Beginning the information architecture at the content page rather than the home page</li>
<li>The kind of content to add to your home page</li>
</ul>
<p>I highly recommend this book as well as learning more about information architecture in general.
