<p>In my Organizing Content series, I've been exploring the idea of adding metadata to help topics so you can sort them into different arrangements for different audiences. For example, you could add metadata tags such as "popular" or a specific role or a business goal and then provide entry points that arrange topics based on that metadata.</p>
<p>Since I'm presenting on this topic at the Summit, it would be nice to have a few examples of help systems that actually implement this idea. :) Despite my asking around, I can find none. I have a small system I'm creating for one of my projects, but it would be nice to point to a larger trend. Anyone have any examples of help systems with different entry points?</p>
