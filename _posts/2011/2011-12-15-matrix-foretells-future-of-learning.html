The idea that you can download knowledge is becoming more of a reality. According to Fox News:</p>
<blockquote><p>Scientists from Boston University and ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories in Kyoto, Japan, have used a functional magnetic resonance machine (fMRI) to decode the process of learning.</p>
<p>The procedure - known as Decoded Neurofeedback or “DecNef” – stimulates the visual cortex by sending signals that change the brain activity pattern.</p>
<p>For example, by placing a juggler into a fMRI machine and have them imagine juggling, scientists, can capture the brain patterns and then pass the information onto someone else. (See <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/12/12/what-if-could-download-new-skills-scientists-say-its-possible/">What If You Could Download New Skills? Scientists Say It's Possible</a>.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe in the future, rather than writing a manual, technical writers will get into an fMRI machine and imagine each of the tasks of an application. The brain patterns we produce will be our deliverable, the new manual.</p>
<p>As a side note, try reading the <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/334/6061/1413.full">original article in a science journal</a>. Then compare it with the <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/12/12/what-if-could-download-new-skills-scientists-say-its-possible/">Fox news article</a>. Talk about dumbing down the content!</p>
