<p>In this podcast, I talk with Victoria Koster-Lenhardt, candidate for STC vice president, about her perspectives and plans for the STC. Both Alan and Victoria Koster-Lenhardt are running for STC vice president. I asked Victoria following five questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What's one of the greatest challenge STC members face right now. Any solutions?</li>
<li>What would you like to see differently in the STC?</li>
<li>Local chapters struggle to make their events relevant to members. How would you help fix this problem?</li>
<li>How can you help you resolve the rift between academics and practitioners?</li>
<li>Given the variety of job titles/specializations in the STC, how can  you keep the magazines, conferences, webinars, etc. relevant?</li>
</ul>
