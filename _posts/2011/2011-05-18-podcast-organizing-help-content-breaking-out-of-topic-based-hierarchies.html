<p>I recently gave a presentation at the STC Summit in Sacramento titled "Organizing Help Content: Breaking Out of Topic-based Hierarchies." I would have recorded my presentation, but recording is not allowed. I did, however, record a practice run-through in my hotel room the morning before.</p>
<p>I included a variety of links here. If you want to view slides while listening, click the Audio with Slides option.</p>
<p>Comparing the practice presentation to the real presentation, the practice presentation ended up being about 15 minutes longer. This means I had more time for questions and discussion during the real presentation. Some participants gave me great feedback in the discussion and follow-up afterwards. This presentation is only one part of an ongoing journey in my effort to solve the findability problem with help content.</p>
