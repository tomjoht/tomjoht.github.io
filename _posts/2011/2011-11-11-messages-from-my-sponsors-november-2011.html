<p><a href="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/2011/11/graysquare2.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-10188" style="border:none;" title="Messages from Sponsors" src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/graysquare2.png" alt="Messages from Sponsors" width="125" height="125" /></a>Each technical communication conference I attend, one of the activities that attendees look forward to is strolling through the exhibit hall, perusing the various tech comm booths, picking up freebies and fliers, listening to vendor pitches, and generally taking in the tech comm world of products.</p>
<p>With that in mind, and as an opportunity to give more visibility to my sponsors, I offer a regular "Message from the Sponsors" post. I give each sponsor the opportunity to let my readers know about their products and services. I hope you can think of this post as similar to strolling down a virtual conference exhibit hall (at least a little bit).</p>
<h2>Clarify: Image capture, Image editing and Document Authoring - Together at Last</h2>
<p>So many of us have suffered through the tedious process of capturing screenshots and posting them into Word or some other text editor. When you're trying to communicate quickly, this can be like flying down the highway only to get stuck in the worst Los Angeles traffic imaginable.</p>
<p><a title="Clarify: Image Capture, Image Editing, and Document Authoring" href="http://www.bluemangolearning.com/clarify/download/?utm_campaign=clarify%20technical%20writers&amp;utm_medium=external%20blog&amp;utm_source=idratherbewriting&amp;utm_content=sponsors%20post">Clarify removes the traffic jam</a>. With fast and flexible screen capture tools, you can quickly grab multiple images. As you capture the images, Clarify creates a document for you. Everything you need to author your document is right there, including text entry and image annotation tools, such as arrows, boxes, blur, highlight, borders, image resizing, and cropping.</p>
<p>Clarify is great for banging out a quick how-to, providing fast revision notes to a colleague, or for providing application feedback for developers. And at just $29.99, it's extremely affordable. Clarify is available for both Windows and Mac.</p>
<p><a title="Free trial of Clarify from Blue Mango Learning" href="http://www.bluemangolearning.com/clarify/download/?utm_campaign=clarify%20technical%20writers&amp;utm_medium=external%20blog&amp;utm_source=idratherbewriting&amp;utm_content=sponsors%20post">Download a free 14-day trial </a>and see how much more productive you can be when working with an integrated screen capture, image-editing, and document-authoring tool.</p>

<h2>Information Design online grad programs at Southern Polytechnic</h2>
<p>Life is full of choices. So why choose <a title="Southern Polytechnic online graduate programs" href="http://idc.spsu.edu/">Southern Polytechnic's online graduate programs</a> in technical communication and information design and communication?</p>
<p>Because we've been in the “business” of teaching online for years, so we have the hard stuff down, and our MS degree has been around since 1988--yikes!  Almost before the Internet (well, not quite).  Nowadays, we have an online graduate certificate in tech communication, four advanced certificates, and the full MS in Information Design and Communication, all online.</p>
<p>We've got great grad faculty who practice what we teach, who engage with you in a combination of weekly discussions (asynchronous so you can communicate even in your bunny slippers, if that's what works best for you), and weekly projects that grow to bigger projects, both individual and team-based.  The result: you learn by doing, by sharing, and by producing and you build a great portfolio of your products to take to market.</p>
