<p><a href="{{site.media}}/2011/07/groupon.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-9539" title="Groupon's copywriting" src="{{site.media}}/groupon.jpg" alt="" width="125" height="125" /></a>Valeria Maltoni from Conversation Agent recently wrote about Groupon as an example of a business employing a strong copywriting strategy. Valeria writes,</p>
<blockquote><p>Great copywriting is the secret sauce of successful email newsletters.</p>
<p>Groupon is an interesting example of promotional writing that sells, when attached to the right deals.</p>
<p>(SeeÂ <a href="http://www.conversationagent.com/2011/06/how-content-seals-the-deal-at-groupon.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+ConversationAgent+%28Conversation+Agent%29">Conversation Agent: How Content Seals the Deal at Groupon</a>.)</p></blockquote>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with Groupon, it's a daily deal site, meaning they send you one knockout deal every day in the city where you live. What's unique is their copywriting -- it has a unique, twisted, oddball style to it that keeps your attention. Here's an example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Often used for toting memorable subpoenas or slices of deli meat, books also make for handy spots to place noteworthy photos while ensuring minimal mold growth. Preserve images in a portable and rodent-repelling format with today's Groupon: for $35, you get $115 worth of custom-designed photo books from Photobook America. There is a limit of two Groupon purchases, but only one book and any additional copies of that book may be ordered per transaction. This Groupon cannot be used toward shipping.

<p>The Groupon creative manager spoke at <a href="http://confab2011.com">Confab</a> and explained their process. He said they have <strong>425 creative writers</strong>. Granted, Groupon has daily deals in more than <a href="http://www.groupon.com/cities">180+ cities</a> across the U.S., but still, that's a lot of writers. Many of them are young creatives, fresh with writing degrees and ambitions to put their creative talent to use.</p>

<p>The Groupon strategy clearly works. Except for their controversial ads, which can sometimes offend or annoy readers, their copywriting seems to be driving their business forward.</p>
<p>I envy their voice. At times I wish I could adopt a unique style of writing in my own organization. But I also think Groupon is trapped in their own copywriting voice. Just as it's unlikely that I'll be able to adopt their style in my copy, I doubt they could adopt my style in their copy. My style is plain speech, friendly but without the [forced] cleverness, honest but not pushing the edge [of logic], thoughtful but not [weirdly] analytical. Regardless, Groupon shows us the power of engaging writing. It's what's making Groupon stand out.</p>
