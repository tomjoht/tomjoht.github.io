<p>Hey podcast listeners, check out <a href="http://blog.braintraffic.com/2011/03/introducing-content-talks/">Content Talks</a>, a new podcast by <a href="http://braintraffic.com">Brain Traffic</a> on content strategy. The first episode features Kristina Halverson interviewing Ann Rockley about content strategy issues. It's a great interview, and Ann sounds lively and engaged.</p>
<p>Kristina steers Ann towards detailed stories and experiences as they make their way through a host of content issues. Kristina says they will be producing a weekly podcast show. The audio quality in this show is superb, by the way.</p>
<p>While you're listening to podcasts, check out several others as well. <a href="http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/topics/podcasts/spoolcast/">The Spoolcast</a> from Jared Spool is full of relevant discussions for designers, communicators, information architects, illustrators, web managers, and more. In particular, check out one of his recent shows, <a href="http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2011/03/04/stephen-anderson-the-quest-for-emotional-engagement/">Stephen Anderson, the Quest for Emotional Engagement</a>.</p>
<p>I also enjoy <a href="http://www.technation.com/">Tech Nation with Dr. Moira Gunn</a>. Moira is a skilled interviewer, and her topics are engaging with a general technical interest. In particular, I especially enjoyed <a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4806.html">The Internet Age of Journalism episode</a>.</p>
<p>If you also enjoy webinars, both Scott Abel of <a href="http://thecontentwrangler.com">The Content Wrangler</a> and Sarah O'Keefe of <a href="http://scriptorium.com">Scriptorium</a> produce regular webinars. You can listen to Scott's <a href="http://thecontentwrangler.com/2011/03/14/recorded-webinar-%E2%80%9Cmanaging-technical-writing-teams%E2%80%9D-scott-abel-interviews-richard-hamilton/">interview with Richard Hamilton on Managing Technical Writing Teams</a>. And check out Scriptorium's <a href="http://www.scriptorium.com/2011/03/webcast-dita-best-practices/">DITA Best Practices webinar on Scriptorium with Tony Self</a>.</p>
<p>I'm also planning to produce more regular podcasts. My most recent podcast was an interview with <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2011/03/18/podcast-a-practical-guide-to-information-architecture-with-donna-spencer/">Donna Spencer on Information Architecture</a>.</p>
