I never quite know what to say.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Tom,</p>
<p>I stumbled upon your blog in search of information about becoming a technical writing.&nbsp; I decided to shoot&nbsp;you&nbsp;a quick email in search of a bit of advice.&nbsp; I have a M.A. degree in English and have been working in education (secondary through college level)&nbsp;for&nbsp;the last 10 years.&nbsp; I've also created and edited a creative online literary site and adapted material from the site into a live show that has found success here in Los Angeles, where I currently live.&nbsp; I'm looking to transition into a new career direction that would combine my expertise in writing with my experience in education.&nbsp; Technical writing specifically&nbsp;for&nbsp;e-learning platforms seems like it might be a good option&nbsp;for&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>Based on your experience as a technical writer, do&nbsp;you&nbsp;think certificate programs in technical writing or instructional systems design would be wise&nbsp;for&nbsp;me to pursue???&nbsp; Or, do they hold little value in the field?&nbsp; I have no direct experience in technical writing, though I may have the opportunity to begin editing pieces&nbsp;for&nbsp;a friend of mine who creates corporate e-learning platforms in the new year.&nbsp; Still, I worry I may have difficulty transitioning from the traditional education environment I've occupied&nbsp;for&nbsp;the last decade into the field without some kind of formal education.&nbsp; However, I don't want to waste my money pursuing a certificate if it won't be regarded positively within the field.</p>
<p>-- Amy</p></blockquote>
<p>Re certificates, any education is helpful, and if you have the time and money, go for it. However, sometimes in these academic programs, I hear things from teachers such as, "We teach the latest technologies here. For example, just this week we showed our students how to create drop-down menus in Dreamweaver." Or I hear students say, "We're learning how to create web pages in Word and upload them to a web site." Cringe...</p>
<p>If you're already a skillful writer, the challenge to transitioning into technical writing probably involves technical skills. No doubt the job listings require all kinds of technical know-how that you may not have. If this is the challenge, then a certificate program may not help you. I'm sorry. Academics are more focused on theory and concepts, techniques and methodologies -- not tools. To learn tools, get a subscription to <a href="http://lynda.com">Lynda.com</a> for $25 and go through the courses.</p>

<p>Lynda.com is great for learning tools such as Illustrator, Captivate, Photoshop, and other Adobe products. For more tech-comm-based tools, such as Flare, Robohelp, or Framemaker, you'll have to look elsewhere. Work on learning a handful of tools and put together <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2009/09/22/how-to-get-a-job-in-technical-writing-a-7-step-guide-for-students/">a portfolio</a> showing your ability to use them. You could also find a mentor in your <a href="http://www.stc.org/membership/chapter-search.asp">local STC chapter</a> to guide you.</p>
<p>If you do plan to get a certificate, I think the <a href="http://www.stc.org/edu/online-certificate-courses.asp">STC's certificate courses</a>, taught by professionals in the field, will probably prepare you well.</p>
