<p><em>They</em> has gone singular. So have <em>their, them,</em> and <em>themselves</em>. We're assailed every day by sentences like these:</p>
<ul>
<li>“What's annoying to me isn't <strong>someone</strong> using <strong>their</strong> phone at the table, it's the people who think I      shouldn't use mine.”</li>
<li>“Equity is the right of every<strong> person</strong> to advance <strong>their</strong> well-being.”</li>
<li>“This is a great chance for <strong>anyone</strong> looking to start <strong>their</strong> own business.”</li>
<li>“Open the profile of a <strong>friend</strong>, and add <strong>their</strong> phone number so it's easy to      call <strong>them</strong>.”</li>
<li>“Health management allows <strong>one</strong> to take      care of <strong>themselves</strong>.”</li>
<li>“As a drowning man wants air, as the <strong>lover</strong> seeks <strong>their</strong> beloved, so must you focus on what you want.”</li>
</ul>
<p>I understand how we arrived at this unfortunate unpluraling of pronouns. English fails us. It offers us no word for his-or-her. We have no <em>lui,</em> which those lucky French can say when they mean <em>to him or her</em>. Our singular third-person pronouns — <em>he, his, him, himself, she, hers, her, herself</em> — are all gender-bound. None of these stand-ins stands in perfectly for <em>person </em>or <em>anyone</em> or<em> each.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>He </em>("To each <em>his</em> own")      covers both masculine and feminine conventionally. But this usage has      fallen out of favor because of its apparent bias.</li>
<li><em>She </em>("To each <em>her</em> own")      simply reverses the bias.</li>
<li><em>S/he</em> ("To each <em>his/her</em> own") is      unpronounceable.</li>
<li><em>He or she</em> ("To each <em>his or her</em> own") works, but few      say it.</li>
</ul>
<p>People who reject these imperfect choices have to fill the need somehow. With alarming frequency, they turn to the conveniently gender-neutral<em>, </em>if inconveniently plural, <em>they</em>. ("To each <em>their</em> own.")</p>
<p>Co-opting <em>they</em> is no solution! This practice has become so common, though, that most contemporary style guides now acknowledge the trend as irreversible.</p>
<p>A moment of silence, please, while I recite the Serenity Prayer, especially the part about accepting what I can't change.</p>
<p>Technology has exploded the use of the singular <em>their</em>. Biznik tells me that Jane, whom it recognizes as J-a-n-e, wants to add me to <em>their</em> network. LinkedIn reports that J-o-h-n has updated <em>their</em> profile. Biznik and LinkedIn don't finesse male-or-female nouns here. They n-e-u-t-e-r Shannon and John.</p>
<p>We can do better. We don't have the singular pronouns we want, but we have acceptable alternatives.</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn singulars into plurals. (“As <strong>lovers</strong> seek <strong>their</strong> beloveds…”)</li>
<li>Go ahead, use <em>his or her</em>. (“As the <strong>lover</strong> seeks <strong>his or her </strong>beloved…”)</li>
<li>Switch occasionally between feminine and masculine. (<strong>lover</strong>… <strong>his</strong>, <strong>lover</strong>… <strong>her</strong>)</li>
<li>Switch to a direct address: <em>you</em>. (“<strong>Lover</strong>, seek <strong>your</strong> beloved…”)</li>
<li>Switch to the more inclusive <em>we</em>. (“As we <strong>lovers</strong> seek <strong>our</strong> beloveds…”)</li>
<li>Remove the pronoun altogether. (“As the <strong>lover</strong> seeks <strong>the</strong> beloved…”)</li>
</ul>
<p>A person must stand <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">his/her</span> ground.</p>
<p>A person must stand <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">their</span> ground.</p>
<p>Stand your ground.</p>
