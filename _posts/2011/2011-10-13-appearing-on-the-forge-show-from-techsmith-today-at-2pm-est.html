The Forge is a monthly web show put on by TechSmith, posted on their <a href="http://visuallounge.techsmith.com/the_forge/">Visual Lounge blog</a>. Here's their description of The Forge:</p>
<blockquote><p>New to The Forge? Wonder what it's all about? It's TechSmith's monthly webshow where we talk about screencapture, screencasting, visual communication and more. We share our tips and tricks and chat with interesting guests about a variety of topics to help and inspire you. Sometimes we even have prizes. You never know what will happen on a live show. You can view the archives and past recordingsÂ <a href="http://visuallounge.techsmith.com/the_forge/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was looking over the <a href="http://visuallounge.techsmith.com/the_forge/">past archives</a> this morning, and it looks like an incredible resource of content for screencasters and visual designers. I'm not actually in person in a studio or anything -- just connecting virtually. And there are a number of other guests on the show, so my segment will only be 15 minutes. Still, if you're around in the afternoon, check it out.</p>
<p><b>Oct 14 Update</b>: Here's the recording of the web show:</p>
