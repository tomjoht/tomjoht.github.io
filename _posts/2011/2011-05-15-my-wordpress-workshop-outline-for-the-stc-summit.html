I thought I'd post my outline in case anyone is interested in how I approach these workshops.</p>
<p>In preparing this outline, I realized that my focus on WordPress and blogging has shifted more towards producing content rather than manipulating the technology. Several years ago, you had to be more techie to make adjustments to your theme and get plugins to work. Now, the technology has matured to the point where you really don't have to dive into code. You can just focus on content. However, it has now become more difficult to create content that stands out from other blogs, since new blog posts saturate the world on a daily basis.</p>
