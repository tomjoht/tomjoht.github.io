<h2>Getting your ducks in a row with Congree</h2>
<p>Writing can be a tough gig – getting your ducks in a row for a client or even a potential client can mean hours of polishing and ensuring that what you've done is in conformity with what they want.

But Congree can change that: it can take automatic authoring assistance beyond simply “correcting” text, and into the world of automatically customizing text to your clients' individual needs.</p>
<p>Choose a style guide, whether it's an officially sanctioned one like the Chicago Manual of Style, one of Congree's internally developed guides like our Simplified English for Translation guide, or customize one of your own. Then, Congree will apply your style guide (along with comprehensive grammar, spelling, punctuation, hyphenation, and abbreviation checks) to your text as you type or after you're done.</p>
