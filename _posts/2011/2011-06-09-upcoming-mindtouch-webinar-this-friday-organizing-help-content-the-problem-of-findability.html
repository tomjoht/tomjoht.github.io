The webinar was a joint-discussion with Scott Abel, the Content Wrangler.  Here's the webinar description:</p>
<blockquote><p>Help systems often have hundreds of topics. Arranging this information into a logical  order so that users can find the exact topic they're looking for poses  major challenges for technical writers. We often default to the print  paradigm and produce a table of contents, arranging the content in  hierarchical folders by topic. The problem, however, is that topics  frequently overlap. The logic for organizing the information isn't  always clear. As a result, users often give up on browsing and resort to  search as a means of finding information. But unless they know the  right terms to search for, search results can be fruitless.</p>
<p>One solution is to break out of the print paradigm and provide  multiple methods of organization for the user. By adding metadata to  each topic, the content can pushed and pulled it in different ways.  Arrangements of content by popularity, role, problem, location, story,  format, or other facets can provide readers with alternative ways to  find what they're looking for. These arrangements are becoming more  popular on the web for non-help content. It's only a matter of time  before help systems follow similar patterns.</p>
<p>Join Scott Abel, The Content Wrangler, for a conversation with  technical communication expert Tom Johnson. The two industry veterans  will discuss problems that impede content findability and suggest  strategies for helping attendees improve their technical support sites  by making their content easily discoverable.</p></blockquote>
