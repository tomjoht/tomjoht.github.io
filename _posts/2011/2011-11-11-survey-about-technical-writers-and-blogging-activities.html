<p><strong>Jan 22, 2012 update:</strong> For results of the survey, see this post: <a title="technical communication and blogging" href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2012/01/22/graduate-research-findings-about-technical-communication-and-blogs-in-the-workplace/">Graduate Research Findings on Technical Communication and Blogging</a>.</p>
<p>A graduate student is collecting information about technical writers and blogging. For more information, see her explanation below and then take the survey (it's short):</p>
<blockquote><p>My name is Michelle, and I am a first-year Master's student studying Technical Communication. Currently, I am working on a research project looking at the use of blogs within the job of a technical communicator. I am looking for participants that work in the field of technical communication and use blogs in some capacity while at work. This survey does not require any personal identifiers or specifics relating to where you work to avoid any issues with proprietary information. I will finalize my research and findings within the next month, and I hope to share those findings in early December with those of you who are interested. Thank you to Tom Johnson for posting the link to my survey and to any of you who participate in my survey.</p></blockquote>
