You can <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/QTN6GMF">take the survey here</a>.</p>
<p>Sarah defines authoring as "a publishing workflow that lets you define and automatically enforce consistent organization of information." Typical structured authoring models include DITA, DocBook, S1000D, ATA, and SPL. Flare, Robohelp, wikis, and other help authoring tools and platforms that do not enforce a structure aren't typically considered structured authoring.</p>
