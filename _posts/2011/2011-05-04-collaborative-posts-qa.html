You can read the interview on Kristi's site, <a href="http://whytechcomm.com/tech-comm/collaborative-posts-qa-with-tom-johnson/">Why Tech Comm</a>. Here's an excerpt: </p>
<blockquote><p>When I was deciding on a format for my workshop, Grassroots Documentation Testing, I thought of Tom Johnson's collaborative posts on his blog, IdRatherBeWriting.com. In collaborative posts, Tom poses a question to his readers (who include many seasoned and successful technical communicators), and they respond with advice in the comments.  <a href="http://whytechcomm.com/tech-comm/collaborative-posts-qa-with-tom-johnson/">Read the rest here.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Speaking of collaborative posts, does anyone have a question he or shewould like me to use as the next collaborative post?</p>
