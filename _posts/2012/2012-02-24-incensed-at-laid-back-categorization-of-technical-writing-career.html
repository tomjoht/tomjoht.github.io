<p><a href="http://education.yahoo.net/articles/5_laid-back_careers.htm?kid=1I10C"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-10633" title="#1 Most Laid-Back Career" src="{{site.media}}/laid-back-career-options-thumb1-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>I was completely incensed to read Yahoo's categorization of technical writing as the #1 laid-back career. In <a href="http://education.yahoo.net/articles/5_laid-back_careers.htm?kid=1I10C">5 Low-Stress Career Options</a>, the writer makes the ridiculous claim that technical writing isn't just a low-stress job, but is apparently <em>the #1 lowest-stress job of any</em> <em>career</em> <em>in America!</em></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Laid-back Career #1: Technical Writer</strong></p>
<p>Technical writers often write articles, manuals, and instruction booklets on a variety of topics, including science, technology, business, and medicine. If you're passionate about the written word, you might be interested in a career as a technical writer.</p>
<p><strong>Laid-back features:</strong> Technical writers, which ranked sixth on CNN Money and PayScale's list of "10 least stressful jobs", said they felt less daily deadline pressure because many of the assignments are long term.

<p>Apparently these findings come from interviews with 40,000 American workers! 40,000!!! I was about ready to throw something at my screen in disgust when I looked over at my tech writing colleague and saw this:</p>

<p>Ahhh, figures.</p>
<p>I'm kidding of course. I do agree that technical writing is a low-stress job, but it isn't quite as low stress as some might imagine. Regardless, this is what my wife thinks I do at work all day. (By the way, I would love to see a "What I Actually Do" meme on this topic.)</p>
