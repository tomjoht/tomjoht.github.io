Here are the details:</p>
<p><strong>Writing and Editing Scripts for Video Tutorials</strong></p>
<p>November 15, 2012, 3-4 pm EST.</p>
<blockquote><p>When you're writing scripts for video tutorials, you must address some of the differences between writing and speech. Copy may be well written, but will it sound natural and conversational when someone reads it into a microphone? Will it sound personal and familiar? To write copy that sounds like natural speech, you have to understand the differences between speech and writing. This dichotomy between speech and writing, fortunately, is a discussion that has been going on since Plato. In this webinar, we'll explore some techniques to make your scripts sound more like natural speech. We'll also explore techniques that voiceover artists often use to make copy sound more natural.</p></blockquote>
<p>The webinar costs around $20 depending on your membership. <a href="http://www.stc-techedit.org/tiki-index.php?page=Writing+and+Editing+Scripts+for+Video+Tutorials">Learn more here.</a></p>
