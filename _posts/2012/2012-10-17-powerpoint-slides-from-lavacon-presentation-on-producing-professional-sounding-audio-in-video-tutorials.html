<p>I recently gave a presentation at Lavacon on audio voice over techniques for video tutorials. In case you'd like to view the slides, I uploaded them to Slideshare.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom:5px"> <strong> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/TomJohnson7/producing-professional-sounding-audio-in-video-tutorials" title="Producing Professional Sounding Audio in Video Tutorials" target="_blank">Producing Professional Sounding Audio in Video Tutorials</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/TomJohnson7" target="_blank">Tom Johnson</a></strong> </div>
<p>You can also <a href="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/2012/10/Voice-Over-Presentation-Lavacon-2012.pdf">download the PDF</a>.</p>
<p>Note: I have a few audio and video clips that I had to link out to other websites. I didn't create this PowerPoint with the intention that it would be viewed and understandable without a presenter. Still, you can probably still get something out of it.</p>
