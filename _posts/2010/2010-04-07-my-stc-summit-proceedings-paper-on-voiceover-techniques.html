<p>When you present at the <a href="http://conference.stc.org/">STC Summit</a>, you're supposed to submit a proceedings paper describing your presentation. Given that only a fraction of my followers are members of the STC, and an even smaller fraction are attending the Summit, I'm providing my proceedings paper here: <a href="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/2010/04/Proceedings_Writeup_for_Developing_a_Personal_Voice_in_Audio.pdf" target="_blank">"Developing a Personal Voiceover in Audio"</a> (PDF). (It's allowed under the STC copyright agreement.)</p>
<p>As you know, I wrote about this topic at length on my blog through a series of posts on voiceover techniques. I had about 10,000 words overall throughout the posts. In this proceedings paper, I mostly used the material from these blog posts, but I reduced the length in half. I also implemented some of the feedback from the comments (thank you, by the way).</p>
<p>It turns out that consolidating individual blog posts into a longer essay works well, as I was able to condense it all in just a few hours. Based on this experience, I'm going to write more series posts. Look for an announcement about my upcoming series tomorrow.</p>
