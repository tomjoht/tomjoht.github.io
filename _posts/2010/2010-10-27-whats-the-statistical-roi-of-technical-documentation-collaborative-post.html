<blockquote><p>I have trouble explaining people of the value adds, and measurable  differences, and advantages of technical writing. Is there a case study,  white paper or any other doc that statistically shows the ROI of technical documentation?</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a collaborative post, so if you have an insight to help Kartik answer this question, please add it in the comments.</p>
