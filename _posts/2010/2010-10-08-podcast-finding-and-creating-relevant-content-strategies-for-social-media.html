<p>In the barrage of information created by all the social media channels,  how can you find relevant content? How can you move past forms of noise to actually produce content that engages users? What forms of social media do students respond to the most? These are some of the questions we explored in a presentation I gave to Brigham Young University Provo students earlier this week. This podcast is a recording of the presentation.</p>
<p>The podcast is about an hour long, and I bookended the presentation with some thoughts before and after.</source></audio></p>
