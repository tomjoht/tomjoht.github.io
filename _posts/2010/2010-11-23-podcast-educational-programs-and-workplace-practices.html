<p>Last week we recorded an <a href="http://www.intermountain-stc.org/">Intermountain-STC chapter event</a>, "Educational Programs and Workplace Practices," held in Layton, Utah. The event included a panel of academics from local technical communication programs in Utah. We had six programs represented: BYU Provo, Westminster College, Utah Valley University, University of Utah, Utah State University, and Weber Utah State University.Â About 15 students and a handful of practitioners attended the event.</p>
<p>Here's a description of the program:</p>
<blockquote><p>It's often a mystery to practitioners what Utah's technical communication programs offer. Hiring managers are unaware about the knowledge and skills they can expect program graduates to have. And educators often struggle to understand workplace trends and realities. At this event, a panel of educators will describe their programs and discuss with practitioners the effectiveness of the coursework. Professionals in the audience will provide insight into current trends in the field. This discussion will be enlightening for all professionals, educators, and students in technical communication programs or fields.</p></blockquote>
