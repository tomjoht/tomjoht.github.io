<p><figure><a href="{{site.media}}/2010/04/USNWR-article.pdf"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-6172 " title="U.S. News &amp;amp; World Report article" src="{{site.media}}/usnews-150x1501.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><figcaption>U.S. News &amp; World Report article</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Today a reader said he found me through an article in the May issue of <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em>. I couldn't find the link to the article online yet. But if you click the image on the right, you can <a href="{{site.media}}/2010/04/USNWR-article.pdf">read a scanned copy in PDF format</a> that the reader sent me.</p>
<p>I don't say anything that interesting or revelatory in the short blurb, but it's cool to see journalists turning to bloggers for information like this. The reporter could have called the STC, and I did refer her to the STC as well, but I gave her something a little more quotable.</p>
