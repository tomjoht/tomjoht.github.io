<p>A while ago, our chapter held a half-day eLearning event, and I presented a version of my Developing a Personal Voice in Audio presentation (similar to what I presented at the STC Summit in Dallas). The recording has been sitting on my hard drive for a while, and I thought I'd finally release it. I've also included the rather large PowerPoint file that accompanies the presentation.</p>
