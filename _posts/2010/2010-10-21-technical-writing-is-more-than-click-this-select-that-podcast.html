<p>This is a presentation I gave at BYU Idaho last week to students interested in entering professional writing. For the accompanying slides, <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2010/10/13/technical-communication-careers-getting-started-and-finding-your-niche-byu-idaho-presentation/">see this post</a>. For the overall question I was trying to tackle, see <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2010/09/30/student-contemplates-whether-technical-writing-is-fulfilling/">Students Contemplate Whether a Technical Writing Career Will Be Fulfilling.</a><a href="{{site.media}}/2010/10/podcastbyuidahothumb.png"></a></p>
