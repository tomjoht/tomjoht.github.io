<p>Alex Otil, a student at Northern Illinois University, recently interviewed me for an article titled&nbsp;<a href="http://stc-niu.wdfiles.com/local--files/current-newsletter/STC-NIU%20TechView_Spring%202010_BW.pdf" target="_blank">Tom Johnson: A Modern Day Technical Writer</a>. It's a short article probably mainly of interest to students thinking of entering the field of technical writing. Students will also find the newsletter as a whole full of relevant information about entering technical writing.</p>
<p>By the way, the title of the article definitely deserves a follow-up from the opposite perspective -- a spotlight of an <em>ancient </em>technical writer. (If you click the link to read the PDF, it's the last article.)</p>
