Integrating a <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress blog</a> into your website is one of the most common requests I receive as a <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/wordpress-consulting">WordPress consultant</a>. Whenever someone asks me to do this, I usually recommend moving the entire website into WordPress. That way you can manage all the content in one place. The user experience is more seamless too.</p>
<p>If you're interested in having me convert your website into a WordPress-driven site,Â <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/contact">contact me</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a 5 minute screencast showing a project I recently worked on. In this example, we converted an existing static website to a WordPress-driven site (<a href="http://grandriverhospitaldistrict.org">grandriverhospitaldistrict.org</a>).</p>
