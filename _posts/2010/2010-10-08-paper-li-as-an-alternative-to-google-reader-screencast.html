The problem with Google Reader is lack of content curation. You get a ton of noise, regardless of how fine-tuned your list of feeds are. With tools such as paper.li, which rank the most shared links on Twitter (based on a user's followers, a hashtag, or a list), you can filter out the first layer of noise and more quickly find relevant content.</p>
