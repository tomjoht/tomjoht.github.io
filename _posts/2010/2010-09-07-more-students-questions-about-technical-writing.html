The questions are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Question 1 - Who/what are the people and purposes that you write for now?  And in the past?</li>
<li>Question 2 - What are the kinds of things that you write?</li>
<li>Question 3 - What are the processes, methods, practices you use to write those things?</li>
<li>Question 4 - What are the technologies you use and how do you use them?</li>
</ol>
