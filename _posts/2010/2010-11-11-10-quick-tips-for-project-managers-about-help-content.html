<p>As a follow-up to my last post, <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2010/11/10/when-help-content-is-forgotten/">When Help Content Is Forgotten</a>, my colleague pointed out that having a set of agreed-upon best practices for technical writers is one of the first steps in establishing traction with project managers. Otherwise, project managers can resist or dismiss a technical writer's recommendations as subjective opinion.</p>
<p>In an effort to be concise, here's my stab at the ten things project managers should know when working with technical writers. Imagine formatting these ten sentences in a neat little card that you periodically email to project managers, or that you give project managers when meeting them for the first time. I made them concise so that they'll be read. These are the 10 concepts that all project managers should know about help content.</p>
<h3>10 Best Practices for Help Content</h3>
<ol>
<li>Allocate budget for help content in your project plan.</li>
<li>After your project is approved, contact a technical writer about deadlines for deliverables.</li>
<li>Recognize that what seems intuitive to you may be unintuitive to users.</li>
<li>Technical writers need access to test environments, prototypes, and dummy data.</li>
<li>The user interface is driven by text, so involve a technical writer's language expertise with prototypes.</li>
<li>Because help content is part of the user experience, technical writers work closely with interaction designers.</li>
<li>Expect short guides and visual content rather than long manuals.</li>
<li>If collaboration and distributed ownership are important, consider a wiki platform.</li>
<li>Technical writers are your application's first users -- their feedback can improve usability.</li>
<li>Documentation isn't finished with the application's release, but continues as users submit feedback.</li>
</ol>
