The description of episode 5 is as follows:

> Tech writers - especially those working in software development - are mostly not writing for human readers directly anymore. Increasingly the job involves using automation to generate docs that will be consumed and re-rendered by AI and parsed into code automation tools like CoPilot or Antigravity.
> 
> Tom Johnson, a technical writer at Google and a publishes thoughts on trends in his work at idratherbewriting.com. In this episode, Tom sits down with Yuri, Matt, and Floyd, to talk about how AI has altered his work.

The World Brain: No Experts podcast has an interesting angle on AI. The podcast takes its name and departure point from HG Wells' 1938 essay collection World Brain. Wells published it as the world was on the brink of World War II, and he argued that a global encyclopedia built on a then-new technology called microfilm could bring about world peace — essentially a utopian vision of a universal knowledge system preventing catastrophe.
The hosts use that as an analogy for AI and then pose the central question of the podcast: "What has been awakened? Rough beast, benevolent angel, or boring super appliance?"

They then layer on a few more framing questions: Are there any true experts on AI? Could a handful of "relatively smart outsiders" be any less wrong about what AI is and what it will do than "the glory drunk founders, their whorish enablers, or the terrifying doomsayers"? And finally, can an unstructured conversation between humans meaningfully help us understand the boundaries between us and what's been created?
