During this 3.5 hours, I'll teach you everything you need to know to document REST APIs. You'll learn the essential sections of API reference topics, including how to document resources, endpoints, parameters, sample requests, and responses. I'll teach you how to use Postman to test REST endpoints, how to use cURL on the command line, how to read and document JSON, and more.

You don't need a programming background to write REST API documentation. With some basic familiarity with HTML and an ability to understand simple command line syntax and JSON, you can document the most complicated REST APIs. Of course, to document sample applications in different languages, you'll need more programming knowledge. But the beauty of REST APIs is that they're language agnostic.



If you're thinking of signing up for this pre-conference, be sure to do it before April 15 to guarantee a spot in the workshop. See more <a href="http://technicalcommunicationsummit2016.sched.org/event/5o4O?iframe=no">details about the API pre-conference workshop here</a>.
