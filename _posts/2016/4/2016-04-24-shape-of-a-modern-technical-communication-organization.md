## Presentation description
Here's a description of the presentation:

> Modern writing organizations need skills very different from basic writing. This session will cover the job roles and skills that your organization might need to adopt best practices. For example: content strategy, analytics, web and app development, taxonomist, linguists, etc, and how can you best incorporate these new skills and roles to partner with your writing team.
