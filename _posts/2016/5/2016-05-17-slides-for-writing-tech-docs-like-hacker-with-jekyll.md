In this presentation, I introduce the tech comm conference attendees to Jekyll and how it can be used for authoring technical documentation. I'll try to demo a few of the tasks I describe."

Here's the description of my Jekyll presentation:

> **Writing tech docs like a hacker with Jekyll**
>
>Static site generators are a new breed of documentation tools that are much more common in engineering groups where developers contribute to the documentation.
>
>Jekyll is one of the most popular static site generators, but it is highly similar to others in the same category such as Docpad, Middleman, Wintersmith, and Octopress. You can see a more comprehensive list of the top static site generators at [Staticgen.com](http://www.staticgen.com).
>
>Jekyll projects approach doc as code. All the files are open and editable within a code editor, and your files can live in the same repository as your program code or within the same version control workflow.
>
>Although developers and web engineers love Jekyll, there are significant challenges to overcome when adopting Jekyll for any robust tech comm publishing scenario. Some of these challenges include conditional filtering, single sourcing, PDF output, a robust TOC, search, context-sensitive help, collaboration, SME review, and more.

>In this presentation, I'll share my adventures in using Jekyll and how I dealt with each of these challenges.

Unfortunately, the recordings are only available to Summit attendees, those who are attending the [Virtual track](http://summit.stc.org/virtual-track/), or those who buy the [Summit Playback](http://www.stc.org/education/technical-communications-summit/summit-playback) package.

I'm giving a similar presentation to the [STC Silicon Valley chapter](http://stcsiliconvalley.com//2016/05/02/may-23-2016-writing-tech-docs-like-a-hacker-with-jekyll/) next week (and I'll record and post that one).
