description: "Here are my slides for the Documenting REST APIs workshop I'm giving at the 2016 STC Summit in Anaheim, California. The workshop lasts 3.5 hours. These slides cover a host of topics, including how to use APIs, how to document APIs, how to publish APIs, and more. There are lots of hands-on activities throughout. Some of the activities involve using the command line, the Chrome JavaScript Console, Postman, Git, reading JSON, and more."

You can find more detail in my [API doc course](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/). (These slides are slightly updated from some of the topics in my course, but generally the slide number in the heading title corresponds with the course number.)
