I love communicating information in a clear, easy-to-understand way, which is why I become a technical writer. Prior to working as a technical writer, I did work as a copywriter for a health and nutrition company. I spent endless amounts of time trying to persuade people to buy protein pills that they probably didn't need.

I guess the flip side is that now, as a technical writer, I spend a lot of time writing instructions that many people may never read.
