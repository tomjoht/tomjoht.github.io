I'm now documenting an endpoint in a project at work that includes about 200 lines of code in a JSON object passed in the request body parameter. Inside the body parameter are various levels of key-value pairs and additionally nested objects (and sometimes arrays).

I added a section called [Documenting lengthy JSON objects in request bodies](/learnapidoc/docapis_doc_parameters.html#documenting-lengthy-json-objects-in-request-bodies) in part of my API Documentation course to address the variety of ways people attempt to document long JSON objects. I think most approaches typically fail for this kind of documentation. What do you think is the best approach for documenting long JSON objects?
