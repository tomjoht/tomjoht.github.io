description: "In October 2015 Michael Stowe presented to the STC Silicon Valley chapter about spec-driven development, with a demo of RAML, which is an API specification similar to Swagger. Pretty much everyone who attended his presentation was impressed at how cool RAML is in making API documentation interactive. You can view Michael's slides and listen to the spec-driven development presentation recording here."

## Spec-driven development presentation description

Here's a description of the presentation and a little bit about Michael:

>Spec Driven Development isn’t just changing the way we build APIs, but even the way we share and document them. In this session we’ll take a look at what Spec Driven Development is, and how it ties developers and technical writers to the hip – helping keep documentation in sync, while reducing the work-load required to generate technical documentation, and even allows for use of modern tools such as RAML and the API Notebook that let us write and share documentation in a brand new, interactive way!
