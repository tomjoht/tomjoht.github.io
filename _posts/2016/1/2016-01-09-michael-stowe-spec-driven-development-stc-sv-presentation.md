description: "In October 2015 Michael Stowe presented to the STC Silicon Valley chapter about spec-driven development, with a demo of RAML, which is an API specification similar to Swagger. Pretty much everyone who attended his presentation was impressed at how cool RAML is in making API documentation interactive.

## Spec-driven development presentation description

Here's a description of the presentation and a little bit about Michael:

>Spec Driven Development isn’t just changing the way we build APIs, but even the way we share and document them. In this session we’ll take a look at what Spec Driven Development is, and how it ties developers and technical writers to the hip – helping keep documentation in sync, while reducing the work-load required to generate technical documentation, and even allows for use of modern tools such as RAML and the API Notebook that let us write and share documentation in a brand new, interactive way!

His work has been published in numerous sources including Website Magazine, DZone and InfoQ, and he has spoken at a wide-variety of tech events including API Strat and API World.
