In postings for API documentation jobs, you'll often see requirements like this:

>"Ability to read code in one or more programming languages, such as Java, C++, or Python."

Although your core task may be to document a REST API, most likely there will be numerous client implementations in different programming languages that you will also need to document.

The variety of programming languages creates challenges for technical writers, especially when employers want technical writers, from day one, to already be proficient in every language needed. In this new jobs section, I try to dive into this topic with more depth.
