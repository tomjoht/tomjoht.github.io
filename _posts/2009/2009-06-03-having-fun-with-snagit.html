<p>This week I needed to create some visuals for a PowerPoint to illustrate concepts related to blogging. Since I have limited artistic ability (perhaps even negative artistic ability), I resorted to a stick figure person as a common theme. I spent a while trying to decide which tool to use to draw with. It turns out drawing a basic circle in Photoshop that doesn't have a solid fill is tedious, as are other drawing functions in Photoshop. So I used my favorite little graphics program instead: Snagit.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.asp" target="_blank">Snagit</a> 9 introduces a .snag format that saves every object on the screen as a movable part. Of course it's not as powerful as Photoshop or Illustrator, but it's a lot quicker and easier. I especially like the Add to Quick Styles feature, so that after defining a shape (for example a line of a certain color, width, and shadow) I can save it to the toolbar and access it immediately.</p>
<p>I also enjoy Snagit's general ease of use. It's the one graphics program that <a href="https://seagullfountainblog.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Jane</a> found essential for working with images on her blog. I tweeted the other day that I wished more products would have Techsmith's same usability, and they consequently gave me several product licenses to give away. So look for an upcoming caption contest on my blog shortly.</p>
<p>Here are my little stick figure drawings. You can click the images to see the full sizes.</p>
