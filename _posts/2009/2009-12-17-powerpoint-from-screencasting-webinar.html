<p>If you're interested in the <a href="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/podcasts/Screencasting.ppsx">PowerPoint for my screencasting webinar</a>, here it is below.</p>

<p>I always smile a little when people ask for the PowerPoint, because it just consists of pictures. I resist detailed bullets points on each slide because it locks you into a certain order that may be at odds with your presentation's flow. Also, when you give people text to read while you're speaking, you lose some of their attention.</p>
<p>I promise to record a podcast this week covering some of the same screencasting content, so stay tuned for this.</p>
<p>By the way, the more presentations I give, the more I find that <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2005/12/the_102030_rule.html" target="_blank">Guy Kawasaki's 10/20/30 rule of PowerPoint </a>really is true.</p>
<p>Also, someone asked for examples of screencasts I've done. Most of the screencasts I do are for work and are behind the firewall, unfortunately. But here are several of my screencasts (the first three in the list below) as well as screencasts from other sites.</p>

<p>I'm also finishing a bunch of screencasts for a public-facing project at work this week, so I'll post those when they're ready.</p>
