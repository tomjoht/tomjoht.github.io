<p>I know <a href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a> isn't for everyone (even though David Pogue on the New York Times <a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/15/twittering-tips-for-beginners/" target="_blank">recently praised Twitter's ability</a> to quickly gather information from your followers.) But if you have a blog, you'd be crazy not to provide a Twitter feed for it. On my blog, I give people three main subscription options: RSS, e-mail, or Twitter. Granted, with Twitter they also get other microthoughts, but they also get my post titles.</p>
<p>It's generally a poor practice to use Twitter <em>only </em>to syndicate your RSS feed. But having some information on Twitter is better than nothing. Here's a simple way to automatically set up Twitter to publish your latest blog posts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you're routing your RSS feed through <a href="http://feedburner.google.com" target="_blank">Feedburner</a>. This isn't essential, but you'll kick yourself later if you neglect Feedburner, since you'll have no ability to track your followers (nor change your feed if you change domains).</li>
<li>Sign up for <a href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, of course.</li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://twitterfeed.com" target="_blank">Twitterfeed.com</a>. To get through the Twitterfeed door, you need an open ID (because they're too cool for regular username and password signup). The <a href="https://myvidoop.com/" target="_blank">myvidoop</a> open ID service is most amusing, as it allows you to has you choose images as passwords. However, if you already have a Yahoo login, use that.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Create New Feed </strong>link in Twitterfeed's simple interface.</li>
<p><figure><a href="http://twitterfeed.com"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2962" title="Twitterfeed" src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/twitterfeedpic-399x2071.png" alt="Twitterfeed allows you to push your RSS feed across Twitter" width="399" height="207" /></a><figcaption>Twitterfeed allows you to push your RSS feed across Twitter</figcaption></figure></p>
<li>Enter your Twitter ID, your blog's RSS feed, and how you want the post titles sent across Twitter.</li>
<li>On your site, provide users with a "Subscribe to Twitter" option.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it. Now once you're on Twitter, occassionally toss in a thought or two that you have throughout the day. As Pogue counsels, don't tell us what you just did, if it's something as mundane as eating a peanut-butter sandwich. People aren't so interested in the mundane details of your life, but they are intrigued by your unique perspectives on those details.</p>
