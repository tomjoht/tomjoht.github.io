<p>This podcast is a recording of the Blogging, Podcasting, and Screencasting presentation that I gave to the <a href="http://www.stc-transalpine.org/conferences/vienna-2009/" target="_blank">TransAlpine conference in Vienna</a> in June 2009. In the presentation, I explore what well-known bloggers, podcasters, and screencasters do to inspire readers to become devoted followers rather than just casual subscribers.</p>
<p>Devoted followers stay updated with each new post, podcast, or screencast, eagerly awaiting the next new one. They're intimately familiar with your content and either comment regularly or regularly return to your site. In contrast, casual subscribers may check out the site from time to time (if they even remember the title), but they feel no loyalty to the blogger/podcaster/screencaster. Months could pass without an update and they wouldn't notice.</p>
<p>Rather than explore blogs, podcasts, and screencasts as separate media with their own unique characteristics, I group them together and explore eight common characteristics that make blogs/podcasts/screencasts successful: relevance, story, appropriate revealing, voice, readability, visibility, interaction, and regularity.</p>

<p>If you want to follow the PowerPoint, <a href="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/podcasts/blogging_podcasting_screencasting.ppsx">view it here</a>. It's not sync'ed with the audio, so you just have to guess where I am (but the PowerPoint is mostly visual anyway, since that's my PowerPoint style). Also, because of the length (90 minutes overall), I divided the podcast into two parts. This is part 1.</p>
