<p>If you're a student, you're probably young. You're almost out of college. Where are you going to live? If you want a job in technical writing, you probably need to live in a major city. Most technical writing jobs are located in places where there are IT companies. The more IT companies, the more technical writing jobs.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends/information-technology-industry" target="_blank">Indeed.com</a> shows you trends for IT jobs by location.</p>

<p>It's no secret here. The top locations are New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, D.C., Dallas, San Francisco, Boston, Austin, and Los Angeles -- all major cities.</p>
<p>Last year, Doug Davis <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2007/02/15/post-in-business-columns-of-whats-host-in-stc-by-proedit-guy/">wrote an article</a> about where the most technical writing jobs are. He identifies a similar list of cities:</p>
<blockquote><p>San Jose, California ( Silicon Valley)<br />
Boston, Massachusetts<br />
Seattle, Washington<br />
Washington, D.C.<br />
Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota<br />
Chicago, Illinois<br />
Atlanta, Georgia<br />
Denver, Colorado<br />
New York, New York<br />
Houston, Texas<br />
Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas<br />
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania<br />
Portland, Oregon<br />
Los Angeles/Anaheim, California<br />
Raleigh/Durham/Chapel Hill, North Carolina (Research Triangle)</p></blockquote>
<p>The most recent <a href="http://www.stc.org/stcmembers/salary-database.asp?SSOToken=B%2barXOsq%2bPlG02Dxo3udMYbdWUQ%3d" target="_blank">STC Salary survey database (from 2008)</a> maps a geographic distribution of technical writers and finds the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>The states with the most technical writers are California, Texas, Massachusetts, Virginia, Michigan and Maryland. Only Wyoming seems to have not reported technical writers.</p></blockquote>

<p>According to U.S. News, the <a href="http://www.usnews.com/money/careers/articles/2009/09/15/10-best-places-for-tech-jobs.html" target="_blank">10 best places for tech jobs</a> are Atlanta, Boston, Houston, Huntsville Alabama, New York, Phoenix, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington D.C.</p>

<p>I recommend moving to a major city that appeals to you. If you're really adventurous, you could even move to India. But seriously, location matters. I know that I'll never live in a rural area such as Wyoming because there aren't many technical writing jobs there, as beautiful as Wyoming is.</p>
<p>Moving to a new location, however, is harder than it looks. Rarely will a company hire you from afar. When I was living in Florida looking for a job in Utah, the remote location turned recruiters and employers off immediately. Fortunately my wife's family is in Utah, so while I was vacationing in Utah, I interviewed for a handful of positions here. Then it wasn't such a problem that I was currently residing in Florida, and a good company eventually offered me a job.</p>
<p>Note: If you think moving to a new city is difficult fresh out of college, try uprooting yourself with three kids and a mortgage payment on a house in a recessed economy. Also, forget about landing that contract position in another state and working remotely from home â€“ it just doesn't happen with entry-level writers.</p>
<p>However you manage to do it, go where the jobs are.</p>
