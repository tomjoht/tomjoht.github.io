<p>I know that my site's title "I'd Rather Be Writing" has always struck the wrong chord with those passionate about the <em>technical-writer</em>-to-<em>technical-communicator </em>name change movement. Those familiar with the profession and the semantics around the job title know how limiting and frustrating it can be to see project managers and developers pigeonhole you into a "writing" role when your skills actually extend far beyond this and include multimedia, graphic design, usability, information architecture, project management, and other abilities. </p>
<p>To break this stereotype and to move beyond the "technical-writers-only-write" assumption, I've decided to change my blog title to "I'd Rather Be Technical Communicating." I will grant that the grammar is not spot on, but that's not really the point. By adopting a daring title, it calls attention to the phrase and makes readers reevaluate and reassess their previous assumptions about the critical role that technical <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">writers</span> communicators play.</p>
<p>As an added incentive to gain traction for the movement, I've contracted with CafePress to make T-shirts available with the new site title for the upcoming STC Conference in Atlanta. If you're interested in a T-shirt, add your name in the comment section below the post and I'll let you know as soon as they're available.</p>
