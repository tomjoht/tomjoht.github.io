<p>Scriptorium has created a brief survey about structured authoring. The purpose of the survey is to gather "input from everyone: those who have implemented structured authoring, are planning to implement it, or have decided against it."</p>
<p>The survey only took me about three minutes to complete. When the results are published, each participant receives a free copy (valued at $200).</p>
