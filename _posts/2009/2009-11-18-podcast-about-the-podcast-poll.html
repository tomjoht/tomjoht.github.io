<p>In this brief podcast, I discuss the <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2009/11/16/quick-poll-on-my-podcast-topic/">results of the podcast poll</a> that I published on my site earlier this week. I mostly wanted an opportunity to try out my new Behringer mixer/preamp, and the results of the poll served as perfect fodder for a podcast. In this 15 minutes of audio, I explain the direction that I plan to take my podcast based on the votes and feedback.</p>
<p>Polls, surveys, and feedback are always a good thing. They help me understand not only what my audience values, but what I value too. Thanks for participating.</p>
