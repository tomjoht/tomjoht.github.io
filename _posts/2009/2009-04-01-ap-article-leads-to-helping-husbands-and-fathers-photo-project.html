<p>Many of you may know I was recently featured in an AP article calling attention to the deadbeat role that many husbands and fathers play in keeping up the house and helping with the kids.</p>
<p>Actually, although I was featured, it was more of an example of the positive possibilities about the role husbands and fathers <em>could </em>play, not the negative.</p>
<p>Here are a few newspapers I was featured in:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>That's just the first page of Google. You can <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=tom+johnson+mad+at+dad&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;hs=QFB&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" target="_blank">see more if you like</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, the number of newspapers is not really the point. The AP article was syndicated. Since then, I've received at least a dozen inquiries from people who opened their newspaper and happened to see photos of me helping my children get ready for church. </p>

<p>Last week another AP photographer contacted me with a new project proposal. In an attempt to raise awareness of helpful fathers, he wants to create a multimedia project titled "Helping Husbands and Fathers."</p>
{% include ads.html %}
<p>The project will attempt to portray, in as many nations and cultures as possible, husbands and fathers lending a helping hand with chores, laundry, garbage, bug disposal, dinner, dishes, sweeping, vacuuming, gardening, and countless other duties that fathers so easily neglect to the detriment of their wives and children.</p>
<p>The project will include a wall calendar, displaying a photo each month of a father candidly helping out around the house. (The months will focus on different encouraged actions.) Additionally, the photos will be collected in an overprint size coffee-table book, which fathers can conveniently flip through while watching sports or lying on the couch.</p>
<p>A web collage, set to music (probably <em>Chariots of Fire</em>), will continuously loop through a series of photos on a new website, helpinghusbandsandfathers.com (not yet launched). Post-it notes, pens, and other image-laden paraphernalia will come out of the project as well. And a book on tape or podcast (the decision hasn't been made yet) will include a series of interviews with fathers and the struggles they've overcome in their journey to become helpful.</p>

<p>To kick off the project, the photographer will be staying several days at my house to catch me in candid moments when I happen to be helping out. I will be the first stop in a three-month long photo journey that will take him around the world!</p>
<p>It's an exciting project to be involved in. I only hope I can set the pace for his expectations.</p>
<p>If you would like to participate in the project, either by contributing photos or by volunteering to have a photographer stop by your house, please leave a comment below.</p>
<p><b>Post April 1 Note:</b> The AP article is true, but the whole "Helping Husbands and Fathers" photo project was an April Fool's day joke. </p>
