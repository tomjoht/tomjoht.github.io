<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3551" title="running" src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/running1.jpg" alt="running" width="192" height="142" />This past week I started exercising at lunch—it was the best thing I did all week. Given how sedentary the job of technical writing is, you'd think this would be a no brainer. But in fact, it's not. My company's gym is rarely used. I see just two or three people (out of hundreds) in there during lunch.</p>
<p>While working out, I also listen to podcasts. Lately I'd gotten a bit out of the podcast-listening habit, since I was carpooling with someone who didn't like to take lunch but instead work eight hours straight. After I switched to the bus for transportation (a new bus route opened up in my city), I've been able to embrace a more flexible schedule. </p>
<p>Now that I've been exercising at lunch, I've noticed that I have a lot more energy in the afternoons. I'm not a big exercise guru by any means. I mostly run a little, lift a little, and jump up and down on a small ledge (in an effort to someday dunk a basketball). But the break refreshes my mind, gives me a change of pace, and allows me to feel alive again (unlike the numbness that sets in from sitting in an office chair all day).</p>
<p>This lunchtime hour provides me the only practical time for working out, because when I get home in the evenings, it's so much harder to go for a run with three kids, a wife, dinner, and exhaustion. In contrast, after working for about four hours, I'm ready for a break, and running on a treadmill doesn't look so bad.</p>
<p>If you have an opportunity to work out at lunch, definitely do it. Working out also gives you a perfect opportunity to listen to podcasts. In fact, I can't imagine working out without a podcast. It would be like driving a car without a radio—doable, but not very fun.</p>
