<p>I'm presenting an STC webinar titled <a href="https://access.stc.org/imispublic/Core/Events/eventdetails.aspx?iKey=WEB1216" target="_blank">Screencasting: Video Tutorials for the Web</a> on Dec. 16. </p>
<p><figure><a href="https://access.stc.org/imispublic/Core/Events/eventdetails.aspx?iKey=WEB1216"><img class="size-full wp-image-5162" title="Screencasting webinar Dec 16" src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/screencastingwebinar1.png" alt="Screencasting webinar Dec 16" width="514" height="306" /></a><figcaption>Screencasting webinar Dec 16</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Here's the description:<br />
</p>
<blockquote><p>Screencasts refer to short video tutorials usually embedded on a blog, uploaded to Youtube, or otherwise displayed on the web. Screencasts are part of the explosion of video and other multimedia on the web, and users are growing more accustomed to watching screencasts to learn how to use software. </p>
<p>As with content on the web, you can find a variety of quality with screencasts – from screencasts with terrible audio to screencasts with fuzzy video, screencasts that go on forever, or screencasts with voices from the dead. </p>
<p>Screencasts require a range of skills from the screencaster. You have to understand a bit of sound engineering, videography, learning theory, video formats, microphones, voiceover techniques, storyboarding, and screen recording software. From choosing microphones to reading scripts or narrating spontaneously, there's a lot to master with screencasting. </p>
<p>In this webinar, I will cover the following:<br />
&bull; Sound: microphones, audio formats, post-processing<br />
&bull; Video: formats, integration, length<br />
&bull; Voiceovers: inflection, scenarios, recording strategies<br />
&bull; Engagement strategies: active learning, interactivity, practice</p>
<p>I will include examples throughout. Participants will come away with a grounding in the basics of screencasting, with enough information to get started or to develop your existing skills.
