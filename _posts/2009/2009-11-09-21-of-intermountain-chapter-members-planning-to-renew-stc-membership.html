<p>I'm wary of posting on this topic because I don't want to launch into a long STC discussion. But according to our recent chapter poll, only 21% of our members are planning to renew their STC membership.</p>

<p>Forty six people participated in the poll (we have 77 chapter members). You can read their list of reasons for not renewing <a href="http://app.sgizmo.com/reports/771/201697/IIRJH1VQD787V2WGNDMAKHDNE889GL/?ts=1257738605" target="_blank">in the full survey report</a>.</p>
<p>I'm wondering -- if our chapter is a microcosm for the whole, at what point will the STC have to dissolve or restructure itself? And if it does, what will the restructuring look like?</p>
