<p>We're looking for a contingent senior technical writer to join our User Education team, part of the LDS Church's Information and Communications System department in Riverton, Utah. This is an opportunity to work in an agile environment with about 600+ talented IT professionals. As a member of our team, you'll also get to work with <a href="http://gryphonmountain.net" target="_blank">Gryphon Mountain</a>, <a href="http://blog.paulpehrson.com" target="_blank">Doc Guy</a>, other cool people, and me.</p>
<p>The job has a few requirements you should be aware of. You have to live near the Riverton area (or be willing to move there), you must be a temple worthy member of the LDS Church, and you need to know your stuff (this isn't an entry level position by any means). <a href="https://ldschurch.taleo.net/careersection/2/jobdetail.ftl?lang=en&amp;job=90520" target="_blank">Find out more information and apply online</a>.</p>
