<p>I occasionally receive encouraging emails from blog readers, podcast listeners, people who attended my presentations, and others. These email messages float too quickly through my inbox, so I've created a new site feature called a <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/blogwall">Blog Wall</a> (see the top navigation bar) to capture them more permanently.</p>
<p>On my Blog Wall you can add any general feedback you have about the site, a presentation I gave, or anything else. Of course you can also add comments below posts, but sometimes you just have something general to say. Well, now you have an entire wall to write on.</p>
