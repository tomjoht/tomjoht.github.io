<p>The caption contest today is for a free copy of Dr. Explain. (Note: Originally, today's scheduled prize was Screensteps rather than Dr. Explain, but I had to switch prizes around due to the fact that a previous winner already had Dr. Explain.) I hope you're not getting tired of captions. We still have four more days.</p>
