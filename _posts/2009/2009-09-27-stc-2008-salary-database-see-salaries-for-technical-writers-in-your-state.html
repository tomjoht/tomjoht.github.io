<p>The <a href="http://www.stc.org/pFiles/pdf/2008-Salary-Database.pdf" target="_blank">2008 Salary Database released by the STC</a> this month provides an impressive amount of salary and industry information in easy-to-read, attractive charts and graphics. It's kind of mind blowing how informative and professional this report is.</p>
<p>The depth and quantity of location-specific information available is especially useful to job seekers, employees or consultants negotiating salaries, or technical writers looking to relocate. The salary database will help you evaluate whether you're being paid a fair salary for your location and industry. Note that the report covers only the U.S. and draws upon the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<p>Here are a few highlights:</p>
<ul>
