<p>Each social media site has its own badge. If you participate in a handful of them -- Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter, Tripit, etc -- it can be cumbersome to manage all your social media profiles and badges. <a href="http://dandyid.org" target="_blank">DandyID.org</a> is a site that helps you manage your social identities. It contains a list of 300+ social media services with profile fields for each. </p>
<p><figure><a href="{{site.media}}/2009/03/dandyid.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3116" title="DandyID" src="{{site.media}}/dandyid1.jpg" alt="DandyID" width="419" height="427" /></a><figcaption>DandyID</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>You enter your profile links for the services you participate in. Then you simply add a <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/dandyid-services/">Dandy widget</a> to your sidebar and voila, the widget pulls all of this information from DandyID and displays it in a nice list on your blog. (If you're on WordPress.com or Blogger or just LinkedIn, DandyID also has <a href="http://www.dandyid.org/beta/extend">widget code for you here</a>.)</p>
<p>Rather than having multiple rectangular badge buttons of various sizes and shapes littering your sidebar, the DandyID widget keeps each social media button in an orderly list. I just implemented this on my site, if you look in my sidebar (see "My Profiles on Social Media Sites").</p>
<p>By the way, looking over the 300 social media sites on <a href="http://dandyid.org" target="_blank">DandyID.org</a> is a bit overwhelming. It's kind of cool just to click through to a few sites and see what has been conceived already.</p>
