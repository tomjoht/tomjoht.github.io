<p>The STC <em>Intercom </em>published an article I wrote about <a href="http://writerriver.com" target="_blank">Writer River</a> called "Caught in the Current of Writer River: Building and Participating in Community-Driven Websites." If you're a member of the STC and you have access to the Intercom, check your latest copy (January 2009) or log in to <a href="http://stc.org">stc.org</a> and <a href="http://www.stc.org/intercom/PDFs/2009/200901_12-13.pdf">download the article here</a> (PDF).</p>
<p>If you don't have access, you can <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2008/10/21/caught-in-the-current-of-writer-river-building-and-participating-in-community-driven-websites/">read the original post I wrote</a>, which is nearly the same article but without the awesome graphic that the <em>Intercom </em>designers added.</p>
