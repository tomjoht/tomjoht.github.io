<p><em>James Bond: The History of the Illustrated 007</em> is Alan Porter's latest book. Alan Porter is vice president of Operations at <a href="http://webworks.com/" target="_blank">Webworks</a>, and I've interviewed him before <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2008/05/06/podcast-pushing-your-company-into-the-wikis-blogs-and-social-networks-of-web-20-interview-with-alan-porter-of-webworks/" target="_blank">about their extensive use of wikis</a>. Obviously James Bond isn't a person that comes to mind when we think of technical communicators, but Alan explainsÂ  the appeal of the Bond character from a technical writer's perspective.</p>
<p>I had the chance to flip through the James Bond book at the STC Summit bookstore, and I was impressed by the quality. Full color pages, large format, insightful commentary on each page. This book would make an interesting read, especially given the longstanding appeal of Bond in comics, novels, and movies.</p>
