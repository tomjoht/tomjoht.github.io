<p><a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2009/09/21/chrysler-owners-manuals-go-digital-for-2010-saves-20-000-trees/" target="_blank">Chrysler moved their car manuals</a> from the traditional thick paper manual to a shorter format  accompanied by a DVD. Chrysler says the switch will not only save 20,000 trees a year, the videos on the DVD will also be more helpful to users trying to perform tasks. The shorter quick reference guides will still be 60-80 pages long (judging from the photo below, they also look more attractively designed). </p>

<p>With my emphasis on quick reference guides and video tutorials, I feel like I've followed a similar move as Chrysler's. I do like to have a car manual in my glove box, but only for simple, quick information -- what type of oil, what does this or that light mean, how do you change a bulb, etc. I don't need to know the full array of reference information. When I need that info, I can look it up on a computer and print off the relevant topics.</p>
<p>(There's a brief discussion on the latest <a href="http://nytimes.com/ref/technology/techtalk.html" target="_blank">New York Times Tech Talk</a> podcast about the move from paper manuals to DVDs.)</p>
