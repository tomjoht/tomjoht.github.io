description: "This post continues my series about how to regain long-form concentration. Although Csikszentmihalyi says the brain's natural state, when left alone without any focused attention, is one of entropy and chaos (more commonly referred to as <i>monkey mind</i>), I'm not sure I agree. In this post, I ask how and why consciousness becomes disordered (monkey mind emerges) in the first place, and how we might change that disorder. In my experience, infinite-scrolling the web and filling the mind with compressed randomness creates different brain patterns than reading a book. Note: Admittedly, in this post, I go off the deep end and do a lot of philosophizing/speculation."

## Context and background for this topic

In my last post, [Applying Csikszentmihalyi's psychology of flow to the writing of technical documentation](/blog/csikszentmihalyi-dynamics-of-flow/), I explained that Csikszentmihalyi says our normal psychological state is one of constant entropy (disordered, unstructured thought). Most people call this "monkey mind," a term coined by Buddha to refer to the way a monkey swings from branch to branch (similar to our mind jumping from thought to thought). 

The whole point of getting into flow, according to Csikszentmihalyi, a happiness researcher, is to counter that entropy with a more "ordered consciousness." Csikszentmihalyi says, 

> The optimal state of inner experience is one in which there is *order in consciousness*. This happens when psychic energy -- or attention -- is invested in realistic goals, and when skills match the opportunities for action. (6)

An ordered consciousness is opposite to psychic entropy. (Csikszentmihalyi doesn't use the term monkey mind here, but it seems so clearer than psychic entropy.) Csikszentmihalyi continues: "This simple truth -- that the control of consciousness determines the quality of life -- has been known for a long time; in fact, for as long as human records exist" (20).

I've covered a lot of straightforward ideas in this series, but they've all sort of leading up to this larger question of achieving an order in consciousness. So bear with me as I wrestle with this more abstract topic.

## Why accept monkey mind as a natural state?

Although I like the idea of getting into a flow state, Csikszentmihalyi's assumption about psychic entropy (monkey mind) being our natural mental state reflects a pessimistic view of human consciousness. I'm not sure I agree with Csikszentmihalyi, as that view reduces the value of our most celebrated quality. Why is my natural state a monkey mind? 

Csikszentmihalyi does address this question in a short section called "Recovering Harmony" (p.227). Anticipating this objection, he phrases it as follows: "Aren't people born at peace with themselves &mdash; isn't human nature naturally ordered?" This is also my objection. Why should my natural mental state be one of entropy and disorder? If it's the case, how did we get that way?

Why can't we have ordered consciousness *outside of flow*? If we only experience flow during optimal times, what does this imply about the majority our time?

## Csikszentmihalyi on pre-conscious states

Csikszentmihalyi says flows basically helps us return to a more pre-conscious state, almost like that of an animal. Csikszentmihalyi says:

> The original condition of human beings, prior to the development of self-reflective consciousness, must have been a state of inner peace disturbed only now and again by tides of hunger, sexuality, pain, and danger. ... If we were to interpret the lives of animals with a human eye, we would conclude that they are in flow... (227)

Look over at your cat or dog, and quietly observe their state. Presumably, the animal enjoys a peace free from the psychic burdens of self-reflective consciousness. I have a young cat that likes to paw at random objects on the floor as if they were mice. In many ways, the cat gets into a state of flow doing this. 

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/cat-at-play-kitchen.jpg" alt="Animals in state of flow" /><figcaption>A cat that directs its attention playfully on an object could be said to be in a state of flow.</figcaption></figure>

But alas, we humans have the burden of a conscious mind, which leads to a monkey mind state (psychic entropy). Csikszentmihalyi continues:

> The forms of psychic entropy that currently cause us so much anguish &mdash; unfulfilled wants, dashed expectations, loneliness, frustration, anxiety, guilt &mdash; are all likely to have been recent invaders of the mind. They are by-products of the tremendous increase in complexity of the cerebral cortex and of the symbolic enrichment to culture. They are the dark side of the emergence of consciousness.” (227).

Animals don't experience "unfulfilled ambition" or overwhelm from "pressing responsibilities." They don't not "weigh possibilities unavailable" or "imagine pleasant alternatives." They aren't "disturbed by fears of failure" (228). These characteristics represent the "dark side of consciousness," which came about due to the "tremendous increase in complexity" of our brains and from advanced culture.

If the point of flow is to order our consciousness, shouldn't we ask, how does our consciousness gets unordered in the first place? 

So let's dive more into the topic of consciousness, why it came about, and why it goes awry. (This post is long. If you only have 30 seconds to spend on this page, you can get a gist of my argument by reading the image captions.)

## How humans developed consciousness 

Csikszentmihalyi doesn't spend much time on how consciousness formed, and his writing about consciousness is more speculative than evidence-based (due to the nature of the topic), but he does briefly touch on it. He says consciousness likely formed due to the following:

* the "biological evolution of the central nervous system"
* "the development of culture &mdash; of languages, belief systems, technologies"  
* "the dubious blessing of choice"
* the transition from "dispersed hunting tribes to crowded cities ... [which] give rise to more specialized roles that often require conflicting thoughts and actions from the same person."
* the juxtaposition of many different social roles, reinforcing the fact that all "see the world different from one another. There is no one right way to behave, and each role requires different skills."
* the "cacophony of disparate values, beliefs, choices, and behaviors."
* exposure to "increasingly contradictory goals, to incompatible opportunities for action" (230)

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/future-civilization-consciousness.jpg" alt="Complexity moves us toward greater consciousness" /><figcaption>The complexity of civilization, with advanced language, technologies, cultural practices, and diverse (often contradictory) perspectives all contribute toward the development of human consciousness.</figcaption></figure>

The overarching theme here is that as civilization grows complex and multifaceted, consciousness increases. These more complex scenarios prompt advanced thought. Csikszentmihalyi says,

> The more complex any system, the more room it leaves open for alternatives, and the more things can go wrong with it. This is certainly applicable to the evolution of the mind: as it has increased its power to handle information, the potential for inner conflict has increased as well. (228)

Csikszentmihalyi doesn't seem too concerned at how humans arrived at consciousness (or an advanced state of mind), only that they do experience consciousness, and the mental state of consciousness is one that drifts toward entropy. Granted, how humans became conscious is one of the big mysteries (and even defining the term usually takes philosophers several chapters), so his lack of a more concrete answer is understandable. However, before dismissing the possibility of a better answer, let's explore one more theory for how consciousness formed.

## Origins of consciousness &mdash; bicameral mind hypothesis

Csikszentmihalyi's *Flow* was published in 1990. About 15 years earlier, American psychologist Julian Jaynes published a book called *The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind,* which posits that consciousness is a relatively recent development (just 3,000 years ago), spinning out of metaphoric language. 

Jaynes says if you look back several thousand years ago, during the time when the *Iliad* was composed (about 8th century BC), you don't see evidence of subjective interiority of consciousness in the characters. The characters don't introspect in explicit ways that embody the thinking, conscious mind. You don't see a Descartes-style mind at work here, nor a Hamlet soliloquy.

Jaynes says that the frequent mention of gods and muses directing events in ancient texts were actually auditory hallucinations from the right hemispheres of people's brains. The left hemisphere incorrectly interpreted these auditory hallucinations as the voices of the gods or other divine sources. Jaynes called this the bicameral mind (for two houses).

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/angel-wispering-in-ear-bicameral-mind.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption>Subjective introspection seems absent in ancient texts. Why? Jaynes says people basically weren't fully conscious. They interpreted the voice in their heads as the voices of gods and muses. In reality, the voice in their heads was their right brain projecting an auditory hallucination.</figcaption></figure>

As written language evolved, specifically metaphoric language, the bicameral mind started to break down. Those auditory hallucinations, which previously originated from the "gods," started to be perceived as emerging from the same human mind. People gradually started to become more conscious, more introspective, pondering and ruminating in their minds &mdash; interacting with the voice in their heads as their own voice, not as that of an external god or muse. 

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/bicameral-angel-no-more.jpg" alt="No more gods whispering into the ear" /><figcaption>The auditory voice of the "gods" was really the conscious mind projecting these thoughts all along. As people evolved and the bicameral mind disappeared, the auditory hallucinations from their right brains ceased. People no longer interpreted the voices as coming from gods. Instead, they recognized it as their own voice. Without the gods directing their actions, many people felt abandoned.</figcaption></figure>

Jaynes' controversial bicameral mind hypothesis remains one of the most fascinating theories about the evolution of consciousness. It caused critics to reconsider their interpretations of the frequent appearances of gods and muses in texts like the *Iliad.* Many started to reinterpret the texts: perhaps the gods weren't literary devices or cultural tropes, but something people literally believed were speaking to them. Jaynes surveys the literature of ancient texts to argue that they truly due lack subjective interiority.

## Language and consciousness

Despite the intrigue of Jaynes' bicameral mind hypothesis, there isn't compelling evidence for it, so it remains a hypothesis (science focuses on what's disprovable). But even putting aside his larger theory, there are aspects to Jaynes' ideas that are interesting, such as the idea that language's use of metaphor gives rise to conscious thought.

Jaynes dissects metaphors into *metaphiers* (the familiar object) and *metaphrands* (the unfamiliar), arguing that is the "most fascinating property of language is its capacity to make metaphors." He defines metaphor in the common way: "the use of a term for one thing to describe another because of some kind of similarity between them or between their relations to other things" (48). But even phrases not typically flagged as metaphors are in fact metaphors. For example, if you say, "the recession is coming," it assumes that the recession is an object, that it has a means of movement (legs?) and that it is heading in your direction (*watch out, the recession is coming for you!*). 

Jaynes says "... metaphor is not a mere extra trick of language, as it is so often slighted in the old schoolbooks on composition; it is the very constitutive ground of language." (48) More importantly, metaphor extends language: "It is by metaphor that language grows" (49). We're used to "seeing" metaphors as merely literary devices in language, one of many rhetorical techniques available, but Jaynes expands the scope of metaphors to make them the foundation of language and thought itself. Jaynes says:

> All of these concrete metaphors increase enormously our powers of perception of the world about us and our understanding of it, and literally create new objections. Indeed, language is an organ of perception, not simply a means of communication. 50

By taking us from the familiar to the unfamiliar, metaphoric language expands our perception. Metaphors lead us into unfamiliar territory, which then prompts us into more advanced thought (and eventually consciousness). Jaynes continues:

> The lexicon of language, then, is a finite set of terms that by metaphor is able to stretch out over an infinite set of circumstances, even to creating new circumstances thereby. (Could consciousness be such a new creation?)" (52)

Jaynes' asks the consciousness question somewhat timidly because he knows it's a stretch. It's through language and metaphor that we perceive new circumstances, and assessing these new circumstances inches us toward more consciousness. 

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/language-and-consciousness.jpg" alt="Moving toward conscious thought" /><figcaption>Metaphoric language helped us consider unfamiliar circumstances and ideas, prompting more advanced thought and ultimately consciousness.</figcaption></figure>

Jaynes also says the symbols in language allow us to assemble and manipulate advanced ideas:

> Subjective conscious mind is an analog [such as a map] of what is called the real world. It is built up with a vocabulary or lexical field whose terms are all metaphors or analogs of behavior in the physical world. Its reality is of the same order as mathematics. It allows us to shortcut behavioral processes and arrive at more adequate decisions. Like mathematics, it is an operator rather than a thing or repository. And it is intimately bound up with volition and decision." (55)

If you consider how mathematical operations (and computer programming) involve converting ideas into symbols that you can then manipulate and perform actions against in complex ways, it's not hard to see how language might perform a similar function. Words act as symbols that we can manipulate in advanced ways, leading to more complex thinking.

## Externalizing thought through writing

I'm not sure if Jaynes' is right about metaphoric language and consciousness (can anyone know?), but there's widespread consensus that language plays a role in the development of consciousness. As someone who frequently writes, I can attest that written language plays a part in promoting introspective thought. 

When you write something, you're literally making your internal thoughts external. This externalization allows you to see your thoughts more concretely, almost from another point of view. As E.M. Forster once said, "How do I know what I think until I see what I say." Let more time pass (years, even) to the point that you forget that you're the author of the written text, and the words become even more external and foreign.

The widespread appearance of this E.M. Forster quotation reinforces its truth. The more you write, the more likely you are to know what you think. Knowledge of what you think  creates self-awareness, and it leads you to deliberate about whether you agree with what you're reading or not. All of this complexity likely leads toward greater awareness and consciousness.

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/think-see-what-say-cons.jpg" alt="How can I know what I think until I see what I say?" /><figcaption>Externalizing our ideas helps us see them from another perspective. This alternate perspective (outside ourselves) can help expand our awareness.</figcaption></figure>

Regardless of how language works, there's no greater tool for thinking than writing. Not only can you see your thoughts in concrete form, you can refine the logic of your arguments, trace out more complex trajectories of ideas, build up elaborate narratives, and more. This post is a perfect example. I am writing about a slippery topic and some of the ideas in my mind are fuzzy. I'm using this post to clarify what I think about consciousness and entropy. I've edited, re-arranged, refined, and clarified my language in hopes of moving toward more clarity. Writing is helping me think. 

## The first time I became aware of consciousness

Language leads to thought, but it seems like thought alone isn't enough to trigger consciousness (awareness of thought?). You need a complex external event to trigger your thinking wheels to start spinning in ways that make you aware of yourself.

I remember the specific moment when I first became aware of my consciousness. When I was about 5 years old, I had a friend who didn't talk much. One day I was having lunch at his house. His mother made us a sandwich and chips, and we sat at his kitchen table, mostly eating in silence. While we ate in silence, I started realize that I could think silently in my mind. I could have a theater of thoughts, whatever I wanted to think about, and no one else could know what I was thinking. Did others have this capability as well? Looking at my friend quietly eating his sandwich, I wondered, was he thinking things in his mind too? Or was his mind blank, without any thoughts other than taking another bite of his sandwich? 

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/sitting-at-table-first-consciousness.jpg" alt="First inklings of the awareness of thought" /><figcaption>Was my ability to think whatever I wanted in my mind my unique, or did everyone possess it? The juxtaposition of a person in a seemingly opposite state prompted reflection.</figcaption></figure>

In this case, my consciousness was prompted through juxtaposition with another human who acted differently from me. The difference prompted questions in my mind. My experience reinforces Csikszentmihalyi's argument that when we "... see the world different from one another, [recognizing that] [t]here is no one right way to behave, and each role requires different skills," it moves us toward consciousness.

I asked my wife if she could remember her first awareness of consciousness. She says when she was a young girl growing up in the Mormon church, someone explained to her the doctrine of polygamy, and she felt repulsed by it. She reacted so strongly that she decided that internally, in her mind, she could believe whatever she wanted and wouldn't have to follow or agree with polygamy. She realized her mind was a private sphere that was hers alone. No one else could enter the castle of her mind. It was her house, her space, and she could think whatever she wanted about polygamy. The outside world had no ability to enter her mind. It was the first time she became aware of her private sphere of thought.

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/shannon-castles-in-her-mind.jpg" alt="You own the castles of your mind. " /><figcaption>When my wife rejected what her church leaders taught, she reveled in her own castles of the mind. She realized it was a space no one else could enter, and she was free to believe whatever she wanted. This thought prompted awareness of her own internal thinking processes and consciousness. </figcaption></figure>

The moment I started introspecting while eating a sandwich with my silent childhood friend, or when my wife realized she could think her own thoughts about polygamy &mdash; were these the starting points for a mental state increasingly filled with, as Csikszentmihalyi says, "unfulfilled wants, dashed expectations, loneliness, frustration, anxiety, guilt" (230)? In other words, how do we move from bright side of consciousness to the dark side of consciousness?

As humans, we usually celebrate our rational faculties. I love to trace and explore ideas in my head. In *Nichomachean Ethics*, Aristotle says the contemplative life leads to the most pleasure:

> And that happiness consists in contemplation may be accepted as agreeing both with the results already reached and with the truth. For contemplation is at once the highest form of activity（since the intellect is the highest thing in us, and the objects with which the intellect deals are the highest things that can be known), and also it is the most continuous, for we can reflect more continuously than we can carry on any form of action.

Our conscious intelligence is the highest form of human nature, so maximizing our highest nature leads to the highest form of living. In fact, Csikszentmihalyi even says philosophy can lead to a form of flow:

> ... playing with ideas is extremely exhilarating. Not only philosophy but the emergence of new scientific ideas is fueled by the enjoyment one obtains from creating a new way to describe reality. The tools that make the flow of thought possible are common property, and consist of the knowledge recorded in books available in schools and libraries. A person who becomes familiar with the conventions of poetry, or the rules of calculus, can subsequently grow independent of external stimulation. She can generate ordered trains of thought regardless of what is happening in external reality. When a person has learned a symbolic system well enough to use it, she has established a portable, self-contained world within the mind (127)

In other words, the seemingly absent-minded philosopher who is really lost in deep thought, running ideas through logical syllogisms to dissect them to their core and then reassemble them back into a whole, enters a flow state, despite the heightened consciousness. 

The entropic mindset Csikszentmihalyi warns against isn't the philosopher focusing on arguments about abstract ideas, but rather the idle person whose mind isn't focused on anything at all (monkey mind, not curious mind). It's "when we are left alone, with no demands on attention, the basic disorder of the mind reveals itself. With nothing to do, it begins to follow random patterns," Csikszentmihalyi says (119). 

> Contrary to what we tend to assume, the normal state of the mind is chaos. Without training, and without an object in the external world that demands attention, people are unable to focus their thoughts for more than few minutes at a time.... Entropy is the normal state of consciousness &mdash; a condition that is neither useful nor enjoyable. (119)

The curious thinker's deep introspection and rigorous examination of ideas, which one might consider the pinnacle of conscious thought, isn't the same dark consciousness that Csikszentmihalyi says is entropic and unordered. Philosophers have learned to train their minds to fully immerse and direct their focus on specific subjects, arguments, and other matters of logic and evidence. They immerse so deeply they become absent-minded, staring off into space in catatonic states. Think of this state as the bright side of consciousness, the one that fills you with understanding of the world and human behavior. How then do we go astray with our consciousness and descend into darkness?

## When consciousness trends toward the dark side

Despite the praise for the intellectual thought, at some point, the conscious state might trend more toward an unwanted state, what Csikszentmihalyi calls the "dark side of consciousness" (227). How does our state of consciousness move from order to disorder? My hypothesis is that the same dynamics that pushed us into the bright side of consciousness &mdash; the juxtaposition of diverse perspectives, metaphoric language (which takes us into unfamiliar spaces), complex and contradictory circumstances (which prompt new thought) &mdash; can, if taken to the extreme, push us into the darker side of consciousness as well. In other words, an ever-increasing immersion in complexity and chaos might propel us into permanent monkey mind. 

Take the scenario of the internet. In *What Technology Wants*, Kevin Kelly describes his love for the internet as follows. Notice how his description revels in the way the internet compresses randomness into one continuous experience:

> I am no longer embarrassed to admit that I love the internet. Or maybe it’s the web. Whatever you want to call the place we go to while we are online, I think it is beautiful. People love places and will die to defend a place they love, as our sad history of wars proves. Our first encounters with the internet/web portrayed it as a very widely distributed electronic dynamo &mdash; a thing one plugs into &mdash; and that it is. But the internet as it has matured is closer to the technological equivalent of a place. An uncharted, almost feral territory where you can genuinely get lost. At times I’ve entered the web just to get lost. In that lovely surrender, the web swallows my certitude and delivers the unknown. Despite the purposeful design of its human creators, the web is a wilderness. Its boundaries are unknown, unknowable, its mysteries uncountable. The bramble of intertwined ideas, links, documents, and images creates an otherness as thick as a jungle. The web smells like life. It knows so much. It has insinuated its tendrils of connection into everything, everywhere. The net is now vastly wider than I am, wider than I can imagine; in this way, while I am in it, it makes me bigger, too. I feel amputated when I am away from it.
> 
> I find myself indebted to the net for its provisions. It is a steadfast benefactor, always there. I caress it with my fidgety fingers; it yields to my desires, like a lover. Secret knowledge? Here. Predictions of what is to come? Here. Maps to hidden places? Here. Rarely does it fail to please, and more marvelous, it seems to be getting better every day. I want to remain submerged in its bottomless abundance. To stay. To be wrapped in its dreamy embrace. Surrendering to the web is like going on an aboriginal walkabout. The comforting illogic of dreams reigns. In dream time you jump from one page, one thought, to another. First on the screen you are in a cemetery, looking at an automobile carved out of solid rock; the next moment, there’s a man in front of a blackboard writing the news in chalk, then you are in jail with a crying baby, then a woman in a veil gives a long speech about the virtues of confession, then tall buildings in a city blow their tops off in a thousand pieces in slow motion.... (322-323)

Since the publication of *What Technology Wants* (2010), more insights about the harmful effects of the content algorithms have emerged. Algorithms optimize for what gets clicked the most. What gets the most clicks? Content that's upsetting, pleasing, shocking, horrific, intriguing, bizarre, funny, tear-producing, hate-filling, inspirational, destabilizing, or otherwise attention-grabbing and consuming. 

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/randomness-of-internet-good-pov.jpg" alt="The internet is the ultimate mishmash of randomness into the same experience." /><figcaption>The internet brings everything together into one experience. It presents the mind with far more chaos and complexity than anything before it.</figcaption></figure>

Look again at the Kelly passage in the context of what Csikszentmihalyi says gives rise to consciousness. The internet amplifies the complexity and juxtaposition of contradictory information. You not only get randomness but also emotional whiplash (cute cat videos juxtaposed with scenes of starvation in Haiti, sports bloopers next to serial killers). 

In Kelly's compressed randomness, we see all of these elements of Csikszentmihalyi's complexity. One sees "specialized roles that often require conflicting thoughts and actions from the same person." One realizes that we "see the world different from one another," that there is "no one right way to behave," that there are "increasingly contradictory goals" and "incompatible opportunities for action." In short, the internet offers up a a "cacophony of disparate values, beliefs, choices, and behaviors" -- streamed right into your brain for many hours a day.

Whereas 50 years ago, the urban city or college campus might have been the space to juxtapose contradictions and different perspectives, now it's the internet. But the internet takes this juxtaposition to new levels of intensity. On the internet, you move from scene to scene as different as night and day, moving across cultural and geographic boundaries without even noticing, being exposed to ideas of every kind, often contradictory, challenging, or upsetting. Maybe this cacophony pushes our conscious brain a bit into overdrive, such that our mental patterns trend toward entropy rather than order. We get too much awareness, too many associations and connections.

Kelly's depiction of his internet experience is one of "beauty" for technology. He enjoys the way so many diverse experiences are juxtaposed into one. But others don't see it that way. Here is one Amazon reviewer's description of the internet, riffing off a theme in Nicholas Carr's *The Shallows*: 

> The brain, confronted with a glowing screen and the ability to hypertext its way from one interruption to another across the universe of knowledge from what its buddy in Australia thinks of rutabagas, to the spelling of rutabagas to the history of rutabagas to dishes that can be prepared from rutabagas leaves the brain sliding from one fact of surface interest to another fact even less useful, until it occurs to the brain to pursue the prompt on the pop-up menu and check the weather and get off of this slide onto the weather channel where a five minute video on playful seals on San Francisco Bay can be watched for free which does remind the brain that it could slide over to Facebook and find out if anyone “liked” the picture of the family cat posted an hour ago. And many do. Twenty-three “likes,” praise the Lord.

Bo Burnham's [Welcome to the Internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1BneeJTDcU&ab_channel=boburnham) does an even better job at portraying the frenetic content mishmash of the internet:

## Changing brain patterns

Perhaps the more we immerse ourselves in the internet, to its patterns of intense randomness, the more our consciousness trends toward monkey mind / entropy. Our brains are neuroplastic and adaptable. If language can alter consciousness, then why not other forces as well? The way surfing the internet compels us to jump around in ways that epitomize randomness, juxtaposition, and chaos might teach out brains to follow similar patterns. 

This past month, I've started to notice an interesting phenomenon. When I try to sleep at night, if I've read a book that day (say, 40 pages of something), my mind seems to follow a more linear, focused pattern, similar to the calm order in which my eyes move left to right across a page, following a larger narrative or argument that an author is making. The act of reading imbues my mind with more order even in a natural state, when I'm "left alone, with no demands on attention" (119), despite Csikszentmihalyi's claim that such a state trends toward chaos and entropy.

<figure><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/reading-and-brain-thought-pattern-alignment.jpg" alt="Reading reduces entropy" /><figcaption>Reading seems to induce harmonic patterns in my brain waves, or something. Read a book for an hour and note your mental state, especially in contrast to surfing the web for an hour.</figcaption></figure>

However, on days where I haven't read a book but instead have been immersed online (ESPN, New York Times, Gmail, Feedly, etc.), my brain has a much different pattern. Instead of linear, focused thought, my mind skips around more. I get monkey mind, jumping from one topic to another. If I'm trying to fall asleep, my racing thoughts will keep me up unless I put an audio book in my ear to focus my attention.

I might not have noticed this contrast in mental states were it not for this whole smartphone experiment (what this series is about). These past two months, I've been more relaxed in my rules about technology use. Earlier on in my experience, I adopted strict rules about when I would use a phone, and so on. My journey away from smartphones led me to read a lot more. When I returned to my smartphone (because my family wanted to text me), I relapsed in other ways too, checking sports and news more often. Then my work provided me with a phone, which came equipped with work email and calendar. I started checking work email more often, in addition to checking my own email almost obsessively. I started reading Feedly (an RSS aggregator) more often. At night I would bring up Youtube.com for entertainment. On Youtube, I even unsubscribed from every channel just to see what the algorithms serve up for me, hoping the videos would lose their appeal, but they didn't. I watched this and that video, usually humor-related, until I was too tired to stay awake. 

But when I closed my eyes and tried to go to sleep, thoughts raced in my head. My mind jumped and flittered about from topic to topic. The only way to sleep was to stay up (watching more videos or movies) until I was so tired that exhaustion itself put me out.

These experiences led me toward certain hypotheses. Maybe what leads to [Tik-Tok brain](https://www.thetealmango.com/technology/what-is-tiktok-brain/), as it's called, where our mental circuits become short-wired and our consciousness drifts toward the anxiety-prone dark side of consciousness, is in the form of the internet itself, which is compressed randomness. Running through post after post of different topics might teach the brain a certain unordered, chaotic pattern that it then imitates -- or continues operating in, following the law of inertia. Contrast this with the more linear, focused pattern of reading from a book, which seems to bring order to my consciousness.

## Several ways a small behavior changes how we think

As more evidence to how reading might influence ordered thought, consider the many studies about meditation's benefits on the mind. If meditation can influence a different state of mind (a different order of consciousness), then why not reading? Alice Walker writes:

> One of the most interesting studies in the last few years, carried out at Yale University, found that mindfulness meditation decreases activity in the default mode network (DMN), the brain network responsible for mind-wandering and self-referential thoughts &mdash; a.k.a., "monkey mind." The DMN is "on" or active when we’re not thinking about anything in particular, when our minds are just wandering from thought to thought. Since mind-wandering is typically associated with being less happy, ruminating, and worrying about the past and future, it’s the goal for many people to dial it down. Several studies have shown that meditation, through its quieting effect on the DMN, appears to do just this. And even when the mind does start to wander, because of the new connections that form, meditators are better at snapping back out of it.

With meditation, the goal is usually to reduce your mind of conscious thought. I'm not an active meditater, but a few years ago I did go through a phase using the *Calm* app to meditate every morning on my way to work for about six months. Each meditation usually follows the same pattern: focus on your breath, in and out. Think of nothing else but your patterns of breathing. Then notice every little sensation in your physical body (this takes your mind away from that DMN mode). 

Meditation like this for 10 minutes a day noticeably made me calmer, more at peace mentally, and less prone to anger or stress. I didn't feel the psychic entropy/chaos that Csikszentmihalyi writes about &mdash; but after a couple of hours behind a computer, my normal state returned. Eventually, I abandoned meditating because the effects didn't last long enough to make the 10 minutes worthwhile. 

If meditation can re-order our consciousness, why not reading? Reading is highly similar in that you focus your mind on a single narrative (like following a breath). Line upon line / breath after breath. 

One researcher explains that the story structure of books can instill a more sequential order in our minds:

> Story structure encourages our brains to think in sequence, expanding our attention spans: Stories have a beginning, middle, and end, and that's a good thing for your brain. With this structure, our brains are encouraged to think in sequence, linking cause and effect. The more you read, the more your brain is able to adapt to this line of thinking. Neuroscientists encourage parents to take this knowledge and use it for children, reading to kids as much as possible. In doing so, you'll be instilling story structure in young minds while the brain has more plasticity, and the capacity to expand their attention span. ([Your Brain on Books: 10 Things That Happen to Our Minds When We Read](https://oedb.org/ilibrarian/your-brain-on-books-10-things-that-happen-to-our-minds-when-we-read/), *Open Educational Database*)

The sequential pattern pushes back the tendency to jump around in monkey mind mode.

Overall, it's plausible that our activities can have an impact on how we think. Here are some direct experiences I've had where the activity changed the thought patterns in my brain:

* If I start posting tweets on Twitter for a week, soon my brain starts coming up with short quippy snippets that might make perfect posts on Twitter. I won't be actively thinking about them, and then a perfectly snarky tweet will spontaneously form in my mind at random times. In short, I start thinking in tweets.

* If I start writing down my dreams as soon as I awake (when I remember my dreams), I notice that I start remembering my dreams more. I once diligently kept a dream journal only to abandon it a couple months later because the many dreams I suddenly started remembering didn't make any sense and their interpretation only frustrated me. After I dropped the dream journal, I remembered fewer dreams.

* If I spend hours trying to solve a technical problem and then turn my attention to something else, my brain continues trying to solve the problem on a more unconscious level. Before too long, I suddenly stumble upon the answer, seemingly out of nowhere. Many eureka moments happen while I'm biking or driving, not actively thinking about the problem.

My point is that you can set in motion different patterns in your brain, and those patterns will continue operating on an unconscious level even after you stop the activity. Many experiments on priming also confirm similar unconscious automaticity. Would it be so controversial to believe that engaging in random infinite-scrolling on the web, accruing hours and hours of daily internet screen time with compressed randomness, might continue on in the unconscious mind? 

And in contrast, the opposite pattern (reading, meditating) might have equal benefits in the other direction, ordering the mind? This morning I started off reading nearly 50 pages in a book about the history of the Detroit auto industry, reading both at home and in a cafe. When I returned home to work on this post, I found my attention continued for 2+ hours straight, typing out this post. In fact, I don't know how long I sat there writing it, as I no longer focused on time. But I cranked out at about 3,000 words, with newfound patience and focus that surprised me. Could it be that prolonged reading (from a sequential book) infused a certain order within my consciousness that protected me from internal distraction?

## Neurodivergence

I'd like to make a couple of notes. First, I've wandered way outside my area of expertise in this post. As I said at the start, I go off the deep end here. I'm a technical writer, not a psychology researcher. I only veered into this territory out of a desire to reclaim my long-form concentration, especially the ability to read books again, despite a decade of smartphone use that seemed to have pushed me in the other direction. 

Secondly, I want to acknowledge that neurodivergent thinkers might not benefit from this post or even this series. I have three family members with ADHD, and I actually spent two afternoons writing this post with two ADHD kids trying to do homework at the table. I've watched as they struggle to stay on track. I know that with ADHD, everything seems to come at them at once, and it's difficult to sequence tasks out into more linear, long-term periods of focus. It's not merely a matter of retraining the brain to counter the inattention learned from social apps; it's much different. So if you have ADHD, the experiences I described in this post might not actually apply.

## Conclusion 

This post has been long and full of abstract ideas. I've tried to bring my own experiences to the table here, as I'm writing to make sense of my own life and habits. The juxtaposition of personal experience with the realm of ideas has always been what excites me about non-fiction. I'd like to conclude with a quotation from Csikszentmihalyi:

> To write down one's insights expecting that someday they will be read with awe by posterity would be in most cases an act of hubris, that "overweening presumption" that has caused so much mischief in human affairs. But if one records ideas in response to an inner challenge to express clearly the major questions by which one feels confronted, and tries to sketch out answers that will help make sense of one's experiences, then the amateur philosopher will have learned to derive enjoyment from one of the most difficult and rewarding tasks of life. (139)

I'm recording ideas here in response to an inner challenge, wrestling with the major questions I feel confronted by, sketching out answers that correspond to my lived experiences. I don't profess expertise from rigorous academic study or inquiry. But I can't help but feel that somewhere in this post, I've hit upon an idea or two that might be true.
