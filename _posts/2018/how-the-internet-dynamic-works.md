description: "After my last post on 2018 tech writing trends went viral (well, as viral as tech comm posts can get), it made me realize how Internet branding works. It's kind of a scary self-perpetuating model that anyone can understand and exploit."

When I analyze my metrics, I find that posts about trends get a lot of visits. For example, my most popular post in 2017 was my trends post (according to Google Analytics). The most popular Write the Docs podcast was the episode on trends (according to Podtrac). Even though some people roll their eyes when trends discussions arise, it only makes sense to write about what people want to read. So ... recently I wrote a 2018 trends post.

My [2018 tech writing trends](http://bit.ly/techwritingtrends2018) post had about 800 clicks on social media (according to Bitly). This is twice as many social media clicks as even my most popular posts, which often get 400 social media clicks. The total visits to the page also skyrocketed, as you can see from this Google Analytics graph:

Traffic jumped from about 1,500 visits a day to 2,500 visits a day during that week (which, admittedly, was kind of a sleepy holiday week, but still).

After this post, I also received two speaking invitations. One STC chapter invited me to speak to their group about trends, and a tech writer at a large company invited me to speak to their tech writing team about trends &mdash; both related to the trends post.

Now, what do you think I'm going to do? I'm going to continue to write more about trends, because it's obviously a huge point of interest for my readers. And I'll probably speak about trends to these groups, if only because I like discussion.

As a result of writing and speaking more about trends, I will become more associated with trends. In fact, this is not a new revelation. I've known trends to be a hot issue in the past as well, so I tailored my site's tagline to say "technical writing *trends* and innovations." I'll continue to write and present more about trends, because it drives traffic, and the more I generate content about it, the more people will seek me about for information about trends. The more people will consider me to be an "expert" about trends. People will start to look to me as an industry thought leader when they think about trends. In reality, I have no special insight about trends.

What you blog about shapes perceptions about your expertise. The more you write about X, the more expertise you're perceived to have about it. In a way, sure, it's true. You can't write a book-load of content about a topic without doing research and having some interesting, helpful ideas about the topic. What I find interesting is the two-way dynamic here.

Bloggers write about what the audience is interested in. As a result, bloggers develop expertise in the audience's interests. 


 in people's heads that you're an expert about that topic, and the more expertise you're perceived to have in an area, the more expertise you actually start to develop. The two behaviors feed off of each other. You could probably make a goldmine of a career by specializing in trends, if that is even possible. Can you imagine devoting an entire blog/book/career out of predicting the future?
