description: "This week I chatted with <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/docsbydesign/'>Bob Watson</a>, an assistant professor of tech comm at <a href='https://engineering.mercer.edu/academics/undergraduate/technical-communication/'>Mercer University</a>, about how to evaluate the user experience of documentation. The idea of doing a podcast came up during a comment thread on a previous post about <a href='https://idratherbewriting.com/simplifying-complexity/reconstructing-the-absent-user.html'>reconstructing the absent user.</a> We had a long exchange in the comment threads and thought it would be good to have a podcast about the topic."

Here are a few questions we cover during the podcast:

* Should tech writers do user testing and research, or is this product team’s job in designing the product?
* Can’t we just leverage marketing personas for the user research we need?
* How can looking at the market and product angles help clarify user needs and behaviors?
* What kind of knowledge can we leverage from universal design patterns about how users consume docs?
* How do we avoid hasty generalizations from a user sample that's too small?
* Is it feasible for tech writers to actually do user testing on top of all of their other duties?
* How can you make feedback forms on docs more likely to get responses from users?
* If you collect feedback at major milestones that users complete, how do you avoid just collecting responses from successful users?
* How does Twilio successfully collect info from their users?
* How can you successfully gather metrics that show user success or failure on tasks?
* How can you make your feedback surveys specific to the data so that you get better responses?
