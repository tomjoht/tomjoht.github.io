You can learn more about the API documentation workshop on [eventbright here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/documenting-rest-apis-a-jumpstart-workshop-for-technical-writers-tickets-49216045517). The workshop will be held from 8am to 5pm at the Quadrus Conference Center.

The workshop will follow my [API documentation course](/learnapidoc/) closely. In fact, I've been updating my [workshop activities](/learnapidoc/docapis_workshop_activities.html) a bit in preparation for the course.

If you're interested, be sure to sign up. Let me know if you have any questions.
