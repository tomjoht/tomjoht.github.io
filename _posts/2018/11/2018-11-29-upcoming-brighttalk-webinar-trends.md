I'm giving a free webinar on January on BrightTALK on trends and the dilemma between being a specialist or generalist.

Here's a summary:

> **Tech Comm Trends: Providing Value as a Generalist in a Sea of Specialists**
>
> Trends in technical communication can be hard to decipher, even when looking at data. But one underlying trend is that technology seems to be getting more specialized and complex. This trend toward specialization is driving up the value of technical knowledge, making it more prized than writing skills. At the same time, writers are often wearing multiple hats as they work on a variety of generalist writing tasks and a diversity of technical projects. The requirement to be both specialist and generalist makes tech comm a particularly challenging field to navigate.

If you're interested, you can [sign up here](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/9273/343232). The webinar is free.
