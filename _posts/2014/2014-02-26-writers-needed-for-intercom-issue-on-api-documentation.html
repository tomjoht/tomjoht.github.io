<p>I'm guest editing an edition of <a href="http://intercom.stc.org/" target="_blank">Intercom</a> that will focus on API documentation (with a planned publication date of September 2014). As guest editor, I need to gather a handful of articles from tech writers with experience in this field. Are you interested in writing an article on API documentation? I have about 8 different topics I hope to cover. See this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sdoqHKuyJ99crjNPcg7HvF9kqPeDYc2QL50Ze39B-cs/edit#" target="_blank">Google doc for details</a>. If you're interested, add your name to the table below the topic you want to cover, and then send me an email.</p>
<p><b>March 1 update:</b> I have enough writers committed for the Intercom articles. However, I'm also starting a series of podcasts related to API documentation, so if you would like me to interview you in a podcast format (conducted via Skype), let me know.</p>
