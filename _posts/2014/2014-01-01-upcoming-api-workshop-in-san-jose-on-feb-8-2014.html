<p><b><i>January 25, 2014 Update: The API Workshop is totally full now. However, we may repeat it in the summer.</i></b></p>
<p>Since moving to California, I've noticed there's a high demand for technical writer jobs involving API documentation, but there's not much in the way of instruction, resources, or other events that provide training with API documentation.</p>
<p>When I mentioned this to some local STC chapter leaders, they encouraged me to find an API expert and organize a workshop around API documentation. So I did. Here are the details.</p>

<p><strong>Workshop Description</strong></p>
<p>One of the hottest markets for technical communication jobs in Silicon Valley is API documentation. Yet few tech comm books, conference sessions, or workshops tend to focus on developing API documentation skills.</p>
<p>One reason is that API documentation is typically seen as the developer's domain, requiring a programmer's level of knowledge to navigate. In reality, technical writers can create helpful API documentation without being full-fledged programmers.</p>
<p>With a working knowledge of the code you're documenting, you can create API documentation that includes descriptions of objects, methods, arguments, as well as code samples and other details to help developers understand how to successfully use an API.</p>
<p>In this all-day workshop, Jim Bisso, a veteran of API documentation and author of <i>Documenting APIsâ€”Writing Developer Documentation for Java APIs and SDKs</i>, will cover a variety of topics to help technical writers get started with API documentation. Specifically, the workshop will include the following:</p>
<p><b>What is an API?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The constituent elements of an API</li>
<li>Programming languages</li>
<li>Objects, operations, and properties</li>
</ul>
{% include ads.html %}
<p><b>What is API documentation?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Doing it by hand</li>
<li>Using tools to generate API docs</li>
</ul>
<p><b>What are the different kinds of API documentation (or developer documentation)?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>API references vs programmer's guides</li>
<li>Tutorials and sample code</li>
<li>Best practices, design patterns, anti-patterns, and idioms</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Writing good API documentation</b></p>
<ul>
<li>How much programming do I need?</li>
<li>How to get information from developers (and other SMEs, support, QA, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Additional topics</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Organization (and style) of API docs</li>
<li>Illustrations: UML and other diagrams</li>
<li>Demo and hands on examples</li>
</ul>
<p>There will also be a broad overview of tools and languages, and some specific sample API docs.</p>
