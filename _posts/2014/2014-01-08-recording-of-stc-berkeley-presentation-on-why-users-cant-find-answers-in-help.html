<p>A few weeks ago I gave a presentation to the STC Berkeley chapter on findability of help content. The recording is available here:</p>

<p>For the slides, see <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2013/10/23/recording-and-slides-for-why-users-cant-find-answers-in-help-presentation-to-stc-silicon-valley/">Recording and slides for why users can't find answers in help</a>. The link refers to the Silicon Valley chapter presentation of the same material -- the slides are the same, but the presentation to the Berkeley chapter (this recording) differed quite a bit given the audience feedback. (My presentation format involves presenting various problems to the audience and inviting them to provide solutions -- hence the difference in the presentations.)</p>
<p>I wrote a post reflecting on some of the discussion here: <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2013/11/19/a-few-things-technical-writers-frequently-say/">A few things tech writers frequently say: Videos tedious, topics best when short, people just use Google, and more</a>.</p>
<p>Note that there may be gaps of periodic silence during the presentation where someone is making a comment. In general I try to rephrase the comment, but I don't think I did a great job at it here. At any rate, the discussion here was quite a bit more interesting than the one at the Silicon Valley chapter, especially concerning topic length.</p>
