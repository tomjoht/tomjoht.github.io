<p>In this podcast, I talk with Scot Marvin, an API technical writer based in Oregon, about some introductory topics with API documentation. Topics covered in the podcast include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The prevalence of APIs 15 years ago compared to today</li>
<li>The definition of an API</li>
<li>What technical writers are responsible to document with APIs</li>
<li>Where technical writers get information about the requests, parameters, and other technical details with APIs</li>
<li>Whether technical writers get info from the API code or from other sources, such as specs</li>
<li>The difference between reading versus writing code</li>
<li>Documentation beyond the reference API that tech writers create</li>
<li>The difference between an SDK and API</li>
<li>Some paths people take that lead them to doing API documentation</li>
<li>Whether tech writers are at a disadvantage without a dev background when creating API doc</li>
<li>What format the response of an API usually delivered in (JSON, XML)</li>
<li>How a REST API differs from a Java API</li>
<li>How does SOAP differ from REST</li>
<li>Examples of some good sample API doc sites, and why</li>
<li>The amount of continual study and learning needed to thrive in API doc space</li>
</ul>
