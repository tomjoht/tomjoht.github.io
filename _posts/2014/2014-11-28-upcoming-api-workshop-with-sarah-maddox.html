<p><a href="https://ffeathers.wordpress.com/">Sarah Maddox</a> will be teaching a full-day technical writing API workshop at the Google campus in Mountain View, California, on January 23, 2015. You can read all the details <a href="http://www.stc-siliconvalley.org/2014/11/21/api-workshop-sarah-maddox/">here</a>.</p>
<p>This workshop is free and includes a catered lunch. It will be held on Friday, January 23, from 9am to 4pm. There is no cost to the workshop, but there is a capacity limit of 110 people for the room. If you want to attend, sign up now so you have a spot. </p>
<p>If you change your mind and decide to cancel, you can &#8220;cancel your order,&#8221; in EventBrite terms. For those who sign up after the room hits capacity, there will be a wait list. If we hit capacity and then people cancel, more spots will open up for those who are waitlisted. </p>
<p>Sarah is coming all the way from Sydney, Australia to give this workshop (as well as attend other Google-related events at headquarters). If you&#8217;ve attended any presentations by Sarah previously, you know she&#8217;s an articulate presenter who communicates clearly and maintains an awareness of her audience. It should be a great workshop. <a href="http://www.stc-siliconvalley.org/2014/11/21/api-workshop-sarah-maddox/">Sign up now</a> before the workshop fills up.</p>
