<p>While I was at Information Development World, I had a conversation with Rick Yagodich about his new book,<em> <a title="Author Experience, by Rick Yagodich" href="http://xmlpress.net/content-strategy/author-experience/">Author Experience</a></em>. This is one of the first books in The Content Strategy series of books. During our conversation, Rick and I talked about the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do people have such poor experiences with CMSs?</li>
<li>What are key considerations authors need in a CMS?</li>
<li>How important is it to see relationships among content in a CMS?</li>
<li>How important are workflows in a CMS, and why are they so problematic?</li>
<li>Can authors have good experiences with their content <em>without</em> having a CMS?</li>
<li>Do CMSs inject tags into your code to handle styles and IDs? Does this make it more difficult to work with the code?</li>
<li>How do you figure out details about CMS vendors such as cost, features, etc, when this information is rarely published?</li>
<li>How does AX differ from a treatment of CMSs?</li>
<li>How can we give so much emphasis on AX over UX? Isn't UX more important?</li>
<li>Why did you pick this topic? What about your background or experiences made you particularly interested in the author experience?</li>
</ul>
