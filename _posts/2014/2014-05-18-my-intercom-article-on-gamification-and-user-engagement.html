<p>I was pleased to have my article, <a href="http://intercom.stc.org/2014/04/gamification-and-user-engagement-in-e-learning-and-documentation/">Gamification and user engagement in e-learning and documentation</a>, included in the Bleeding Edge issue of the <a href="http://intercom.stc.org/magazine/april-2014/">April 2014 STC Intercom magazine</a>. Here's a link to the article:</p>

<p>If you don't have access to the Intercom, you can <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2014/02/04/gamification-and-user-engagement-in-e-learning-and-documentation/">read the same article here</a>, since I posted it on my site a few months earlier.</p>
