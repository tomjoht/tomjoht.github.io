<p class="c9"><em>The following is a guest post by Vinish Garg, an information architect with a background in technical writing who frequently works with startups. </em></p>

<p><figure><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-22045" src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/vinish_garg-125x125.jpg" alt="Vinish Garg" width="125" height="125" /> <figcaption>Vinish Garg shares his thoughts on authoring tools for startups</figcaption></figure></p>
<p class="c9">A discussion on authoring tools invariably leaves the participants with at least one common opinion–they want to see something better in whatever tool they are using. I recall a <span class="c1"><a class="c3" href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2012/12/31/wish-list-for-technical-writing-tools/">Wishlist post</a></span> that Tom wrote a few years back; I am not sure how much we can revise that wish list today. The next common facet of such a discussion is a quiet shared laughter about the tools.</p>
<p class="c9">Making a decision on an authoring tool depends on many factors. I often receive messages on LinkedIn with authors seeking my advice on selecting authoring tools. Their questions remind of <span class="c1"><a class="c3" href="http://www.decathlon.in/">Decathlon</a></span> when it opened its first store in Chandigarh. One of my sports enthusiast friends went to the store, and on browsing the aisles, was not sure of what to pick -- the rackets, a club, or the baseball gloves. Not sure what to start, and why.</p>
<p class="c9">However, when we talk about startups, the process to select an authoring tool is quite different. Ryan Hoover from <span class="c1"><a class="c3" href="http://www.producthunt.com/">@producthunt</a></span> says that Product Hunt gets 250-300 product submissions a day, and of these, only 50-60 get listed. So startups are really mushrooming, and that is good news.</p>
<h2 class="c7"><span class="c16">Documentation for Startups: Approaches and Priorities</span></h2>
<p class="c9">In last few years, I have worked with a few startups as a contractor. Either they had just launched a product and were connecting with their first customers, or they were about to launch.</p>
<p class="c9">A startup has a different <span class="c17">approach</span> to documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li class="c6"><strong><span class="c10">Priority and Urgency</span></strong><span class="c2"><strong>:</strong> Customers are their only priority, and so they need minimum content to help guide their first customers.</span></li>
<li class="c6"><strong><span class="c10">Minimum Viable Content</span></strong><span class="c2"><strong>:</strong> They often need MVC to begin with; they cannot afford to dedicate exclusive time or resources for documentation. Mark Baker has an excellent post titled </span><span class="c2 c1"><a class="c3" href="http://everypageispageone.com/2014/10/20/in-praise-of-short-term-thinking/">In Praise of Short Term Thinking</a></span><span class="c2"> that is quite relevant to startups' documentation strategy.</span></li>
<li class="c6"><strong><span class="c10">Team, SME</span></strong><span class="c2"><strong>:</strong> Most often, startup teams are small, and the owner or CTO is our SME.</span></li>
<li class="c6"><strong><span class="c10">On Board</span></strong><span class="c2"><strong>:</strong> Startups cannot afford a technical writer on board; they do not plan to hire one either, and they are not sure if they will have ever have a permanent writer on board.</span></li>
<li class="c6"><strong><span class="c10">Long term Strategy</span></strong><span class="c2"><strong>:</strong> When I try to learn their long term documentation vision, they are not sure of it (e.g., other deliverables, whether different documents for different users, multiple languages).</span></li>
<li class="c6"><strong><span class="c10">Budget</span></strong><span class="c2"><strong>:</strong> Startups are often low on budget (even if funded).</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="c9"><span class="c17">Preferences and Priorities</span></h2>
<p class="c9">Before I share my experiences of startups' documentation preferences, let me share a few example startups. Pick a random product from @producthunt. I picked a few randomly, including <span class="c1"><a class="c3" href="http://louder.org/">http://louder.org/</a></span>, <span class="c1"><a class="c3" href="http://knotable.com/#/">http://knotable.com/#/</a></span>, <span class="c1"><a class="c3" href="https://videolean.com/">https://videolean.com/</a></span>, <span class="c1"><a class="c3" href="https://supportyard.com/">https://supportyard.com/</a></span>, and <span class="c1"><a class="c3" href="http://www.spokepoint.com/">http://www.spokepoint.com/</a></span>. The products often have a FAQs page, or a "<span class="c17">How It Works"</span> page for basic instructions for their customers. Generally, startups have the following documentation preferences:</p>
<ul class="c0 lst-kix_list_1-0">
<li class="c6"><strong><span class="c10">Deliverables: </span></strong><span class="c2">The online manual is the only deliverable, in one language. They need an authoring platform that they can use themselves, to write if required. </span><span class="c2 c8">They don't have time or resources for XML schemas, or to set up rules and validations, so a case for an XML authoring tool falls flat.</span></li>
<li class="c6"><strong><span class="c10">Self-authoring:</span></strong><span class="c2"><strong> </strong>They want a platform that allows them to write themselves. The team starts writing guides (articles) close to the launch. They want a Google Drive Doc, a simple WordPress theme, or help desk KB authoring platform. When they have an author on contract, they prefer to continue it in some cases, by writing quick notes or drafts that authors can take over. No review sheets, and very little back-and-forth.</span><span class="c2 c8"> So help authoring tools such as RoboHelp, Flare, and Author-IT do not interest them; and they lack budget to spend on such HATs.</span></li>
<li class="c6"><strong><span class="c10">Collaborative authoring</span></strong><span class="c2"><strong>:</strong> They want collaborative authoring to track versions, revisions, and a simple web-based "write-save-review-approve-publish" publishing process. </span><span class="c2 c8">Wikis are an appealing option here.</span></li>
<li class="c6"><strong><span class="c10">Analytics and metrics</span></strong><span class="c2"><strong>:</strong> Analytics and metrics are important; they are often interested to see and share </span><span class="c10">Most Popular Topics</span><span class="c2">, </span><span class="c10">Top Rated Topics</span><span class="c2">, </span><span class="c10">Recently Viewed Topics</span><span class="c2">, and so on. </span><span class="c2 c8">A CMS serves this need well.</span></li>
<li class="c6"><strong><span class="c10">Cloud Based, Hassle Free</span></strong><span class="c2"><strong>:</strong> They need a tool that does not need any installation, configuration, and troubleshooting. It should be cloud based and affordable.</span></li>
<li class="c6"><strong><span class="c10">Branding and Styling</span></strong><span class="c2"><strong>:</strong> They prefer to have control over the branding and styling, with basic theme settings by drag-and-drop interfaces, and CSS tweaks. </span><span class="c2 c8">A CMS shows them a rosy picture here.</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c10"><strong>Integration:</strong> </span><span class="c2">They need integrations with help desk systems such as Zendesk, Desk.com, UserVoice, and with online chat services such as Olark.</span></li>
<li class="c6"><strong><span class="c10">Advanced Search:</span></strong><span class="c2"> They need a powerful search feature, possibly powered by AJAX, or by integrations with </span><span class="c2 c1"><a class="c3" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.algolia.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG6mcz1L64amnBJUg-FkFk8mdHYaA">Algolia</a></span><span class="c2">.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="c4"><span class="c10">Other Documentation Factors for Startups</span></h2>
<p>Here are a few other documentation factors with startups:</p>
<ul class="c0 lst-kix_list_1-0">
<li class="c6"><span class="c2">I often advise startups to plan for reusable content chunks so that we could plan for Quick Guides, Admin Guides, or Inline Help in the future.</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c2">There is no formal process for issue tracking, so integration with tools such as JIRA is a low priority.</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c2">Startups need an easy way to set up and manage information hierarchy </span><span class="c2 c8">(such as categories of topics, and content chunks if possible).</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c2">Startups do not have a vocabulary or terminology guide. </span><span class="c2 c8">(With a single writer authoring in one language, consistency is not a concern.)</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c2">Not many startups need PDF versions such as for Quick Start Guides, but it is a nice to have. </span><span class="c2 c8">A CMS allows publish to PDF; most cloud based services don't.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="c11 c9"><span class="c16">Authoring Tools: Options</span></h2>
<p class="c9">Here's a quick look at a few broad level categories of authoring tools:</p>
<ul class="c0 lst-kix_list_1-0">
<li class="c6"><span class="c2">HATs (RoboHelp, Flare, Author-IT, Help&amp;Manual, and few more)</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c2">XML Editors (OxygenXML, EasyDITA, Arbortext Editor, and few more)</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c2">Wikis (Confluence, Wikis)</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c2">CMS (WordPress, Drupal, and others)</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c2">FrameMaker (I am not sure where I can list FM above, hence its independent space)</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c2">CCMS (or custom support services such as by MindTouch?), way out of their budget</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c2">Cloud based (ScreenSteps, Zendesk, Elev.io, and few more)</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c2">Quick Simple Site Generators (Jekyll, DocPad, and possibly few more) (</span><span class="c10">Thanks</span><span class="c2"> </span><span class="c10">Tom</span><span class="c2">, for pointing these two to me)</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c2">A variety of scripts and APIs for advanced options such as </span><span class="c10">Agolia</span><span class="c2"> for Search, </span><span class="c2 c1"><a class="c3" href="http://www.weststreetconsulting.com/WSC_InsetPlus.htm">InsetPlus</a></span><span class="c2"> for content reuse, and few more</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c2">There may be a few quick-fix or custom authoring workflows as Tom described in </span><span class="c2 c1"><a class="c3" href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2014/02/25/a-simple-way-to-write-edit-and-publish-documentation-online-using-google-docs-and-markdown/">Using Google Docs and Markdown</a></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c9 c14">Now considering the startups needs and priorities, I can conclude that startups</p>
<ul class="c0 lst-kix_list_1-0">
<li class="c6"><span class="c2">rarely opt for DITA or even XML-authoring environment in a HAT</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c2">are resistant to HATs for lack of authoring flexibility for the basic learning curve</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c2">have a strict No to CCMS for cost and learning curve</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c2">dislike wikis as they lack custom search features and don't scale well to adjust with additional deliverables</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c2">may not always like Jekyll or DocPad because not many authors can use these (e.g., I saw DocPad, and there is no GUI, I am not sure how we can fetch related topics automatically, and how taxonomy works)</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="c9 c11"><span class="c16">My Experience</span></h2>
<p class="c9">I have worked with a few startups for their documentation tasks. A quick recap on my experience:</p>
<ul class="c0 lst-kix_list_1-0">
<li class="c6"><strong><span class="c10">WordPress</span></strong><span class="c2"><strong>:</strong> I worked with two clients who decided to use WordPress for their documentation. Their corporate website was developed in WordPress and hence they opted for WordPress for their their KB. Their reasoning for choosing WordPress was as follows: (1) They were familiar with the authoring (in spite of its limitations) and (2) They could carry the same branding. For one client who implemented WP, their whole KB was developed in WP. For another, their documentation was developed in a HAT, and they planned to export and publish it to a WP theme.</span></li>
<li class="c6"><strong><span class="c10">Cloud Based Authoring</span></strong><span class="c2"><strong>:</strong> I have two clients who are using ZenDesk for KB authoring. I talked about the detailed experience in </span><span class="c2 c1"><a class="c3" href="http://www.vinishgarg.com/2014/09/kb-case-study-pain-points-and-analysis/">a few blog posts</a></span><span class="c2">. I also used HelpIQ and ScreenSteps. Both are just enough to set up basic documentation; each has its own limitations.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="c11 c9">So, the Options for Startups</h2>
<p class="c12 c9"><span class="c2">Startups have few options for help authoring:</span></p>
<ul class="c0 lst-kix_list_1-0">
<li class="c6"><span class="c2">Default KB  themes from open source CMS such as WordPress (see some examples on </span><span class="c2 c1"><a class="c3" href="http://themeforest.net/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;term=knowledgebase&amp;sort=&amp;view=list&amp;category=wordpress&amp;price_min=&amp;price_max=&amp;sales=&amp;rating_min=&amp;date=all">themeforest</a></span><span class="c2">)</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c2">Cloud based authoring tools (I see UserVoice and ZenDesk being used so often)</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c2">Quick Simple Site generators (given that they provide a GUI, basic customization of content types, and taxonomy support)</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c9 c12"><span class="c2">Based on my experience, the minimum wishlist for startups' authoring tools is:</span></p>
<ul class="c0 lst-kix_list_1-0">
<li class="c6"><span class="c2">Collaborative authoring, with reviewing and revisions</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c2">Snippets for reuse</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c2">Custom taxonomy</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c2">Content chunks (such as to import videos from an external source)</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c2">Role-based access to an authoring environment, and to front-end users</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c2">Custom branding and styling</span></li>
<li class="c6"><span class="c2">Custom views to fetch specific set of topics</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c9">Do you think that easy and lightweight CMSs or cloud-based authoring tools are a better option for startups?</p>
