<p>A while ago I posted some thoughts on <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2014/10/29/simplifying-dita-authoring-by-using-a-markdown-to-html-to-dita-workflow/">converting Markdown to DITA</a>. I refined this conversion process using the Multimarkdown script and OxygenXML. Here's a demo:</p>
<p><video class="loopingVideo" id="video1" width="600" onmouseover="this.play()" preload><br />
    <source src="{{site.media}}/markdowntodita.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br />
<source src="{{site.media}}/markdowntodita.ogg" type="video/webm"><br />
    <source src="{{site.media}}/markdowntodita.webm" type="video/webm"><br />
  </source></source></source></video></p>
<p>(There's no audio to this 20 second video -- it just loops over and over.)</p>
<p>I added more details on how to configure this in my DITA QRG: <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/md2html2ditav2">Author in Markdown, Publish with DITA</a>. </p>

<p>Why would you want to convert from Markdown to DITA? Mainly, you would use this script in the content development stages of a project. As you're gathering information, finding out details, adding and removing steps from lists, and otherwise developing your information, you need a quick way to author and shape content. Markdown offers this quick syntax for creating content. </p>
<p>Once you get to a point where you want to start working with the XML, such as re-using notes or adding specific attributes to different elements, convert it all to DITA and work with it there.</p>
<p>Note that you can't create DITA specific elements in Markdown, such as notes. But you can author a lot of elements that do carry over.</p>
