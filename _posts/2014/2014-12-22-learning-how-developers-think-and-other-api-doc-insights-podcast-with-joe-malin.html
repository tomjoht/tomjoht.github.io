<p>In this podcast, I talk with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=2698799">Joe Malin</a> about a variety of topics within API documentation, including how developers think, best practices, and more. Joe is a former software engineer who turned to technical writing many years ago. He has worked at a variety of companies in API documentation roles, including 7 years at Google.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the topics we cover in the podcast:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why Joe turned from software programming to writing</li>
<li>What kind of API documentation he is currently working on</li>
<li>Best practices for API documentation</li>
<li>The brilliance of REST APIs as a means of interchanging information</li>
<li>Whether REST API doc is easier than platform-API doc</li>
<li>How much programming a person needs to know to do API documentation, particularly Javadoc</li>
<li>How developers think, and other insights gained from learning programming</li>
<li>Benefits of using Github and other source control repositories to share documentation</li>
<li>His response to someone who says, "Well if I could write code, I would be a programmer instead of a technical writer."</li>
<li>Contributions tech writers can make with code samples, including style guides for code</li>
<li>Applications for visual communication with code</li>
</ul>
