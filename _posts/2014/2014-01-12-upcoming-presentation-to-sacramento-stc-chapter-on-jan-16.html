<p>I'm presenting to the <a href="http://www.stcsacramento.org/calendar.html">Sacramento STC chapter on January 16,</a> 2014. It's a similar presentation I've given to the <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2014/01/08/recording-of-stc-berkeley-presentation-on-why-users-cant-find-answers-in-help/">Berkeley</a> and <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2013/10/23/recording-and-slides-for-why-users-cant-find-answers-in-help-presentation-to-stc-silicon-valley/">Silicon Valley chapters</a>. You can view past recordings, slides, and other resources <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2013/10/23/recording-and-slides-for-why-users-cant-find-answers-in-help-presentation-to-stc-silicon-valley/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now that this is the third presentation, though, I have changed this presentation a bit. I'm really reworking the first point about information fragmentation. I sort of took a lot of heat at the Berkeley chapter for my preference for long topics. I know the right way to approach this point now.</p>
<p>I'm also expanding the SEO part of the presentation. I have a lot to say about <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2013/12/16/seo-duplicate-content-and-single-sourcing/">duplicate content online</a>, etc.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you're in Sacramento on Jan 16, come check out my presentation.</p>
