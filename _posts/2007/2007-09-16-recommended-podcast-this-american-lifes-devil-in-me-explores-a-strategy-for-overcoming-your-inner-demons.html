<p><a href="http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?sched=1205" title="This American Life Devil in Me episode" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/340_sm1.jpg" title="Devil in Me" alt="Devil in Me" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" /></a>If you enjoy podcasts, check out Act One of the <a href="http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?sched=1205" title="Devil in Me" target="_blank">"Devil in Me" episode</a> of This American Life. The episode explores how Iraqi war veteran Sam Slaven returns from Iraq with post-traumatic stress syndrome and a fear of Iraqis.</p>
<p>Just being in the same room with an Iraqi makes him start trembling and thinking of ways to remove him (for example, by "choking him out").</p>
<p>Sam recognizes the irrationality of his fear. After he enrolls in college, he decides to join a Muslim Student Association (MSA). After several months of attending the MSA's meetings and activities, he develops a close friendship with a Muslim. The friendship completely changes him. </p>
<p>Sam's experience shows us one way of dealing with our fears: immersion in the very thing we fear. The producer's larger vision (of all the acts in the show) is to explore battles with inner demons.</p>
<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p>Sam's strategy might work well for physical fears, perhaps, but what about more abstract fears? For example, my wife is terrified of snakes (not sure why). If she were to watch <em>Anaconda </em>she would probably start hyperventilating and run from the room. Following Sam's therapeutic technique, one way of overcoming her fears might be to immerse her in a cage of snakes. :)</p>
<p>But what if your fear is more abstract -- fear of failure, fear of humiliation, fear of not becoming anything, fear of unemployment, fear of death? I'm not sure if the same strategy would apply.</p>
<p>At any rate, the therapist in the Devil in Me episode recommended to Sam that he approach his fears with a more gradual introduction of the thing he fears, rather than complete and immediate immersion.</p>
<h3>Question for Readers</h3>
<p>What do you fear the most? How do you deal with that fear?</p>
