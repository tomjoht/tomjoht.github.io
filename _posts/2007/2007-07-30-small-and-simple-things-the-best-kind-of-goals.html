<p><img src="{{site.media}}/books11.gif" title="books" alt="books" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" />I was reflecting today on Avery's love of reading. When Avery was a baby, Shannon and I had a goal of reading her 3 books a night before bed time. We thought it would be a good idea, and this goal turned into a habit and routine that we have kept up over the years, for the most part.</p>
<p>I've watched other parents put their children to bed in 5 minutes, not reading them anything. Now that we've been reading to Avery at bedtime for nearly six years, it's unthinkable not to read to her. This small and simple goal has given Avery a love of reading.  Little activities, magnified over time, can have great effects. I think these small, frequent goals are the best kind.</p>
