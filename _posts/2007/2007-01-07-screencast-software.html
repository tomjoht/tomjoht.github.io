<p>I've been looking for some screencast software that is either open source or inexpensive. I've arrived at the following two applications: <a href="http://www.debugmode.com/wink/" target="_blank">Wink</a> and <a href="http://www.bbsoftware.co.uk/BBFlashBack.aspx" target="_blank">BB Flashback Express</a>. Wink is open source and in version 2 they finally support audio (previous versions did not); however, the audio recording is full of static and cuts out. Additionally, the file size seemed to be a little bulky.</p>
<p>BB Flashback Express has clear voice and seems to compress more, but it costs $39. However, if you donate a buck to <a href="http://www.donationcoder.com/Specials/index.html" target="_blank">Donationcoder.com</a>, you can get BB Flashback Express for $20.</p>
<p>I am often lured by open source software, but the extra time I spend trying to fiddle with it may cause it to be more expensive in the end anyway.</p>
<p>My thoughts are that if it's free, more people will be using it, and more tutorials will exist out there. Others will be more apt to experiment with it.</p>
<p>I plan to do more screencasts, so I may just spend $21 to get BB Flashback Express.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>After doing some sample tests with each, I found that BB Flashback Express sounds much clearer than Wink.<br />

<p>Note: I also experimented with <a href="http://www.camstudio.org/" target="_blank">Camstudio</a>, but when I realized that it did not play in Firefox, this killed the appeal for me.</p>
