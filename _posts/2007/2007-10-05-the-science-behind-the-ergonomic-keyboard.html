<p>In this podcast, Microsoft Usability Researcher Hugh McLoone talks about Microsoft's Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000. Hugh originally gave this presentation to the Puget Sound (Seattle) SIGCHI group on January 25, 2007. SIGCHI stands for Special Interest Group for Computer-Human Interaction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Heidi, who attended the presentation, says, "As you'll hear, Hugh was a driving force behind the ergonomic keyboard. This podcast will appeal to technical writers both from the perspective of usability and also from the perspective that we type all day and can benefit from hearing about ergonomic keyboards and preventive health issues.</p>
<p>The presentation is approximately 35 minutes, and the Q &amp; A session has been removed for the sake of brevity."
