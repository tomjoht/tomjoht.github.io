<p>I'm leaving for the STC conference in Minneapolis tomorrow. I asked my cohost Heidi for a hit list of people to interview, and she gave me a dozen names. I'm not sure how I'll track them down, but look out if you're on my list ...</p>

<p>I'm also looking forward to the summit hike. Never been hiking with other technical writers.  :) (See the slogan beneath the image above if you missed my joke.)</p>
<p>Strangely, a lot of the value of conferences comes from talking and interacting with other technical writers <em>outside </em>the sessions, including talking with those who aren't presenting. So I'm hoping to interview lots of attendees as well. (I bet people will make some really candid statements they'll later beg me to remove.)</p>
<p>Unless something goes wrong (like there being no way to upload files to my web host), I should be posting a bunch of interviews on Tech Writer Voices soon.</p>
<p>If you're in Minneapolis and want me to interview you (or if you have a recommendation for someone to be interviewed), call me at 727-612-0856.</p>
