<p>In this <a href="http://mschoen.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=281803" target="_blank">three-minute STC Atlanta podcast</a>, Judy Glick Smith says she's tired of trying to convince sales people of the value of documentation. She says she's "tired of fighting the good fight."</p>
<p>No doubt as a technical writer you've heard the phrase, "No one reads the help anyway." They let out a small chuckle to indicate that they're only kidding, although deep down they're being totally serious. Many people believe help files are almost insignificant except to a small percentage of people.</p>
<p>But the next time you hear someone say, "No one reads the help anyway," say, "Yah, no one uses Google either."</p>
<p>This will lead to a puzzling follow-up question -- <em>What do you mean? I use Google all the time. </em></p>
<p>Then you say, What do you use Google for? To search for answers, solutions, and information when you have questions?</p>
<p>Google is one large help file.</p>
