<p>We had our first chapter chat tonight. It went well. The conversation moved at a good pace, no flame wars broke out, and the discussion seemed productive. The one downside was lack of participation on part of the chapter: only four members participated (including myself). However, sometimes if you're talking with a group of friends, four people is a perfect number. Imagine trying to carry on a conversation with 50 or 60 people at once. That might cause the chat window to scroll nonstop.</p>
<p>Here is the <a href="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/2007/03/suncoastchat_march2007.pdf" title="chat transcript">chat transcript</a>. You have to read it from bottom to top, but even then, a chat is a little like a audio conversation. You can record it, but you don't get the full effect unless you're there.</p>
<p>Here's what really worked well during the chat:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having someone act as the host</li>
<li>Avoiding sarcasm</li>
<li>Keeping the members on track with a topic</li>
<li>Trying to pull everyone into the conversation</li>
<li>Not making the chat too long (one hour is perfect)</li>
</ul>
<p>Mark Hanigan asked if I could explain how to set up a chat for other groups. Basically, here's how you do it:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2007/02/04/installing-wordpress-a-quick-audiovisual-tutorial/" target="_blank">Install a WordPress blog</a> through the Fantastico feature of your web host's cPanel.</li>
<li>Install <a href="http://pierre.sudarovich.free.fr/" target="_blank">Pierre's Wordspew shoutbox plugin</a>.</li>
<li>Create a new page template and name it something unique. See the WordPress codex to learn about <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Pages" target="_blank">page templates</a>.</li>
<li>Create a new page based on the page template and put the shoutbox plugin code on that page.</li>
<li>Use the plugin editor and modify the CSS style associated with the plugin to fit on a page.</li>
<li>Turn the refresh rate of the chat box from 4 seconds to 0.1 seconds.</li>
</ol>
<p>That probably doesn't make much sense if you're not familiar with WordPress. Sorry, it would take about a half hour to really explain it all. But it's not hard at all if you know a little about WordPress.</p>
