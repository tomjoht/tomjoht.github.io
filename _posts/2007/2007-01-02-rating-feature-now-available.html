<p>I installed some post rating plugins to the site. Now you can rate posts on a  scale of one to five stars. The highest rated posts are aggregated in a section  on the sidebar. Also, the most rated posts are also aggregated in a section on  the sidebar. I've been wanting to implement this feature for a while, because it  makes the site more interactive and interesting.</p>
<p>Look at the bottom of each post to see the stars. Simply select the number of stars the post deserves.</p>
<p><img src="{{site.media}}/rating.gif" alt="rating" id="image149" /></p>
<p>The highest rated and most rated posts appear in the right sidebar.</p>
<p><img src="{{site.media}}/aggregation.gif" alt="aggregation" id="image150" /></p>
<p>Update: No one rated anything, so I removed this feature.</p>
