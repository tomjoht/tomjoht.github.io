<p>This is a presentation titled "Creating Help in the Web 2.0 Age" that Neil Perlin gave to the <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com" target="_blank" title="Suncoast Chapter">Suncoast Chapter</a> in Tampa, Florida in February 2007. Neil talks about what Web 2.0 is, and how help can be delivered on the fly according to specific user requests. This is a bit of a long file -- perfect to listen to on your way to the STC Conference.

<p>Here's a more formal description of the presentation that Neil wrote: For years, technical communicators have created help on a mass industrial model – one finished help system for all users. But two technologies, XML and Web 2.0, offer ways to change that model, letting us create just-in-time help personalized to specific users' needs, with content written by users themselves. How does this work?</p>
<p>In the case of XML, a feature in a specific authoring tool, Flare, lets us automatically create help systems that reflect the needs of specific sets of users, possibly even specific users, when those users request help. In the case of Web 2.0, we get the flexibility to let end users write content themselves, taking some of the load off technical communicators.</p>
<p>This all sounds futuristic and idealistic, but the automatic Flare output has already been done on a test basis, and user-contributed content is all around us – in wikis, for example.</p>
<p>This presentation discusses the philosophy and technologies behind these two new approaches to creating help. It illustrates the specific place in Flare that lets us create automatic, just-in-time output. It then looks at the philosophies, technologies, and implementations of user-contributed content.</p>
