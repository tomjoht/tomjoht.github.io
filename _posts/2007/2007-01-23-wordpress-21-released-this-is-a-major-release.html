<p><img align="right" src="{{site.media}}/ella2.gif" alt="ella wordpress release" title="ella wordpress release" />Big news in the WordPress world -- 2.1 has been released. I think we've been waiting about a year for this major upgrade.</p>
<p>You can <a target="_blank" href="http://wordpress.org/development/2007/01/ella-21/">download the release</a> from WordPress here.</p>
<p>Here's an excerpt from WordPress about what this release includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Autosave makes sure you never lose a post again.</li>
<li>Our new tabbed editor allows you to switch between WYSIWYG and code editing instantly while writing a post.</li>
<li>The lossless XML import and export makes it easy for you to move your content between WordPress blogs.</li>
<li>Our completely redone visual editor also now includes spell checking.</li>
<li>New search engine privacy option allows you take you to indicate your blog shouldn't ping or be indexed by search engines like Google.</li>
<li>You can set any "page" to be the front page of your site, and put the latest posts somewhere else, making it much easier to use WordPress as a content management system.</li>
<li>Much more efficient database code, faster than previous versions. Domas Mituzas from MySQL went over all our queries with a fine-toothed comb.</li>
<li>Links in your blogroll now support sub-categories and you can add categories on the fly.</li>
<li>Redesigned login screen from the Shuttle project.</li>
<li>More AJAX to make custom fields, moderation, deletions, and more all faster. My favorite is the comments page, which new lets you approve or unapprove things instantly.</li>
<li>Pages can now be drafts, or private.</li>
<li>Our admin has been refreshed to load faster and be more visually consistent.</li>
<li>The dashboard now instantly and brings RSS feeds asynchronously in the background.</li>
<li>Comment feeds now include all the comments, not just the last 10.</li>
<li>Better internationalization and support for right-to-left languages.</li>
<li>The upload manager lets you easily manage all your uploads pictures, video, and audio.</li>
<li>A new version of the Akismet plugin is bundled.</li>
</ul>
