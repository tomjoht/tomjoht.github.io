<p>For a long time now I've wanted to make a chapter member map mashup with Google maps. To see what I'm talking about, look at this page: <a href="http://stc-suncoast.org/map.html">http://stc-suncoast.org/map.html</a>. I'm not finished putting all the members up there â€” this is obviously just a start.</p>
<p><a href="http://stc-suncoast.org/map.html"><img src="{{site.media}}/map.png" alt="google map mashup" title="google map mashup" align="left" hspace="6" /></a></p>
<p>Google Maps <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/maps/" target="_blank">has an API</a> that allows you to blend your own data with their mapping system. It's really much easier to create a Google map mashup than it may initially appear.</p>
<p>To create a member mashup with Google maps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/maps/" target="_blank">Google API page </a>and sign up for an API key. This is a long string of digits you'll need.</li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://www.econym.demon.co.uk/googlemaps/examples/map.htm" target="_blank">this sample page</a>, right-click to view the source code, and copy the source code.  More map <a href="http://www.econym.demon.co.uk/googlemaps/" target="_blank">possibilities are here</a>.</li>
<li>Paste the source code into a notepad file, change the API key to your own API key (this appears near the top after the word "key"), and save the file with a .html extension.</li>
<li>Look for the following text in your file:// Set up three markers with info windows<br />
var point = new GLatLng(43.65654,-79.90138);<br />
var marker = createMarker(point,'&lt;div style="width:240px">Some stuff to display in the First Info Window. With a &lt;a href="<a href="http://www.econym.demon.co.uk">http://www.econym.demon.co.uk"&gt;Link&lt;/a</a>&gt; to my home page&lt;/div&gt;')<br />
map.addOverlay(marker);</li>
<li>Replace the coordinates inside GLatLng() with the coordinates of the markers that you want. To convert your addresses into coordinates, use <a href="http://geocoder.us/" target="_blank">single geocoder</a> for small addresses or this <a href="http://www.batchgeocode.com/" target="_blank">batch geocoder</a> for larger jobs.</li>
<li>Replace the text "Some stuff to display in the First Info Window..." with text that you want to accompany your marker.</li>
<li>Repeat that chunk of marker text for as many markers as you want to create.</li>
<li>Upload the .html file somewhere on your directory. Voila, your Google mashup map appears.</li>
</ol>
