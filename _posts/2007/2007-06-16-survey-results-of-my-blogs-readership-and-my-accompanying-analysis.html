<p>Last week I <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2007/06/04/who-are-you-a-one-question-survey-to-identify-my-readers/" title="survey about who my readers are" target="_blank">posted a survey</a> on my site asking who my readers were. Here are the results of that survey.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.surveygizmo.com/reports/771/3905/6F21Z448NIR0QOKPZAY9P6D1X0DF3J/" target="_blank" title="survey results"><img src="{{site.media}}/survey1.gif" alt="survey" /></a></p>
<p>You can view the report <a href="http://www.surveygizmo.com/reports/771/3905/6F21Z448NIR0QOKPZAY9P6D1X0DF3J/" title="report" target="_blank">here as well</a>.</p>
<h3>Geographic Breakdown</h3>
<p>Here's a geographic breakdown of where my readers are located.</p>
<p><img src="{{site.media}}/readers1.png" alt="geographic representation of readers" /></p>
<h3>Survey Analysis</h3>
<p>Most of my of my readers are in technical communication. They're more interested in blogging than podcasting, and only a handful have met me personally.</p>
<p>This means I'm largely writing for strangers. A lot of my posts are descriptions of good podcasts I've listened to. But if readers aren't interested in podcasts, these recommendations may have little appeal.</p>

<h3>What Is Blogging's ROI?</h3>
<p>I have been a little concerned about the ROI of blogging lately. I'm thinking that â€”</p>
<ul>
<li>Blogging requires a lot of time without producing any direct monetary rewards.</li>
<li>Only a tiny percent of my readers actually know me personally. (What kind of relationships am I building?)</li>
<li>Neither blogging, podcasting, or wikis seem to be skills in demand in the field of technical communication. (If you find a job description for a technical communicator that even mentions the word blog, wiki, or podcast, let me know. I don't think they exist. Or if they do, they're one in a thousand.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>How Readers Consume Blogs</h3>
<p>After the survey dropped off the front page, I had only a few more respondents. This confirmed my suspicion that even though you may have written 250 posts, only the last 10 exist to your reader. This leads to the <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2007/06/16/techcrunch-founder-interview-on-iinnovate-arrington-talks-about-how-blogging-is-a-treadmill/" title="Arrington's treadmill" target="_blank">treadmill effect Arrington described</a> -- the idea that blogging is like running on a treadmill. You just keep putting time and energy into something that goes around and around without taking you anywhere.</p>
<p>Ideally, blogs should present readers with a neatly organized view of posts related to their interests. The index doesn't really work (for example, see <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/index" title="index" target="_blank">my index</a>). Neither do users peruse categories much (at least I don't). Perhaps providing related posts, top ten categories, and other aggregations that appeal to users is more useful.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>I decided to build in more embedded navigation into each post. Now at the end of each post, I show you 10 Related Posts and also the Top 10 Posts on my Site. Since 70% of my site visitors are supposedly first-timers (according to Google Analytics), it might make sense to provide per-post navigation like this.</p>
<h3>Any Feedback ?</h3>
<p>Do you have any thoughts for my about my analysis? I'd really like to hear them.</p>
