<p>I've been experimenting with an "Ajax shelf" to help users find pages better on the <a target="_blank" href="http://stc-suncoast.org">Suncoast chapter site</a>. The Ajax shelf is like a web component that slides up and down when you click a button. I think it's pretty cool. Here's an example:</p>
<p>Shelf is hidden:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/shelf11.gif" title="ajax shelf hidden"><img width="500" src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/shelf11.gif" alt="ajax shelf hidden" title="ajax shelf hidden" /></a></p>
<p>When the user clicks the View Pages link, the shelf expands:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/shelf22.gif" title="ajax shelf expanded"><img width="500" src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/shelf22.gif" alt="ajax shelf expanded" title="ajax shelf expanded" /></a></p>
<p>When the shelf expands, it has the effect of sliding down. When you click the View Pages link again, the shelf slides back up.</p>
<p>I've decided to store all my pages on the Ajax shelf. Because I'm using the Suncoast chapter site as a little CMS, I'm hoping that this way of organizing the pages will make it easier for users to find information.</p>
<p>I'm still tweaking the <a target="_blank" href="http://stc-suncoast.org">Suncoast site</a>, but what do you think of the Ajax shelf part?</p>
<p>The theme I am using has the Ajax shelf functionality, but you can apparently add a shelf to your blog manually by following <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wiphey.com/2006/04/11/tutorial-k2-ajax-shelf/">this tutorial</a>. (I haven't tried the tutorial.)</p>
<p>Ajax, by the way, is just javascript, and stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. Keith Hoffman wrote more about Ajax in his <a target="_blank" href="http://stc.org/intercom/pdfs/2007/200701_4-7.pdf">Intercom article on Web 2.0</a>. Hoffman mostly talks about the collaboration functionality that AJAX provides with online word processing programs. He says Ajax allows multiple authors to simultaneously work on a document and have each person's changes saved instantaneously. So Ajax has many different applications — the shelf is just one.</p>
