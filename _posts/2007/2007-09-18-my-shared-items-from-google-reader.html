<p>Google Reader lets you share posts from the feeds you read. Right now I have a tremendously long commute in a carpool and I started using Google Gears' offline reading for my feeds. It works quite well -- until the car starts winding around a narrow mountain road and I feel like I'm going to throw up. But for a while, it does allow me some time to check out my feeds.</p>
<p>At the top of my blog there's a link called "<a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/14956448268706131592" title="shared from google reader" target="_blank">shared from google reader</a>."</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/shared1.png" alt="Shared items from my Google Reader" /></p>
<p>The shared items shows all the posts I've come across that I think are worth reading (for my interests anyway).</p>
<p>The shared items page even comes with a <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/14956448268706131592/state/com.google/broadcast" title="my shared items feed" target="_blank">feed</a>. This shared feature is one of the neatest and easiest ways to share good posts without creating a link blog.</p>
<p>If you have a shared feed with Google too, let me know. Also, if you've never used Google Gears (which allows you to read your feeds offline), check out this <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/launch/access-your-google-reader-feeds-offline-with-google-gears-264682.php" title="Lifehacker tutorial on google gears" target="_blank">tutorial from Lifehacker</a>.</p>
