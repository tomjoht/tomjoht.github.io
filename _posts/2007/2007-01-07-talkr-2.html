<p><a href="http://talkr.com/" target="_blank">Talkr</a> is a service that converts your blog automatically into a podcast (a computer reads it). I haven't tried it yet, but it looks interesting. Unfortunately Yahoo had a podcast with something like this, but listening to a robot proved unbearable after a while. Perhaps as the computer's ability to read with a human-like voice improves, podcasts will become more ubiquitous. Still, it would enable me to read all the technical writing blogs that I intend to read but never seem to do.<br />
