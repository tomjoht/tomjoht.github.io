<p>I'm relocating to Utah in late August to accept a new job. I'll be working for EMC, which does contracts with the army base in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dugway.army.mil/" title="Dugway">Dugway, Utah</a>. Dugway is about 80 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, remotely located in the Salt Lake Desert (see image below).</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.dugway.army.mil/" title="Dugway"><img width="502" src="{{site.media}}/englishvillage1.jpg" alt="English Village in Dugway, UT" height="268" style="width: 502px; height: 268px" /></a></p>
<p>We'll be driving over from Florida, which is about a 2,400 mile drive. We'll actually live in Tooele rather than Dugway. Tooele ("Tuwilla") is a small town (population = 30,000) about 45 min. north of Dugway.</p>
<p>If you have any advice for long distance drives or moving, let me know. We're really excited about this move. My wife's family is from Utah, I went to Brigham Young University for my undergraduate degree, and I love the Utah landscape and people. Additionally, the responsibilities of this tech writing job look like a perfect fit for me.</p>
