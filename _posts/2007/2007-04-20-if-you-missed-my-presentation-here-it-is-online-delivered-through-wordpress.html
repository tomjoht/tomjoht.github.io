<p>Also relevant are some posts I published last week. Read my posts on <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2007/04/15/wordpress-themes-best-themes/" title="themes" target="_blank">themes</a> and <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2007/04/17/wordpress-plugins-extending-your-blogs-features-and-capabilities/" title="Plugins" target="_blank">plugins</a>.</p>
<p>If you don't have time to read those posts, at least check out <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/themes">my theme viewer</a> and <a href="http://idrathebewriting.com/plugins">plugins used</a> page.</p>
<p>And don't forget the post that increased my readership from 80 subscribers to 250: <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2007/04/09/twenty-usability-tips-for-your-blog--condensed-from-dozens-of-bloggers-experiences/">Twenty Usability Tips for your Blog: Condensed from Dozens of Blogger's Experiences</a>.</p>
<p>Where are the PowerPoint slides, you ask? I am using WordPress as my PowerPoint tool. It made more sense for my topic, and it was more fun to work with.</p>
