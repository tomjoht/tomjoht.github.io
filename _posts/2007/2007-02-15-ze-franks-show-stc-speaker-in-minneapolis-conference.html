<p>You probably saw the brief descriptions of the <a href="http://stc.org/54thConf/keynote/index.asp" target="_blank">two keynote speakers at the STC Conference</a> in March, but did you know one is a podcaster. Or a videocaster, or a new media artist. The <a href="http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/archives/2007/02/021407.html" target="_blank">show with zefrank</a> is an interesting new video art form. He does some creative, theatrical commentary while looking at your straight in the eye.</p>

<p>Click the image above to see Ze Frank talk about Google and Valentine's day and "Googe." The show is a satire on Google's omission of an L in their Valentine's day mock up, but there's no overwhelming point to it other than artistic expression. He's like a humor columnist on video.

<p>I haven't watched too many of these because I don't have a video iPod, but they are pretty funny. Not quite as good as <a href="http://askaninja.com/" target="_blank">Ask a Ninja</a>, though. Even my kids like Ask a Ninja. Do you listen to any videocasts like these?</p>
