<p><a href="http://davidmcnamee.com/default.aspx" target="_blank" title="David McNamee">David McNamee</a> presented on Vista and Office 2007 to the Suncoast chapter in May 2007. This is a recording of his presentation. He talks about how the purpose of Vista and Office is to help you create, find, and share information more efficiently. Don't worry that you can't see Vista or Office 2007 in the podcast -- visualize it. He adds a lot of information about the concepts and philosophy behind the new ribbon approach, in addition to other usability and design factors.</p>
<p>There's not a lot on online help in this podcast.
