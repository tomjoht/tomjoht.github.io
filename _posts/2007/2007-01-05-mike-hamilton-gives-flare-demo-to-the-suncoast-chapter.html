<p>Mike Hamilton from <a href="http://www.madcapsoftware.com" target="_blank">Madcap Software</a> visited the Suncoast chapter in Tampa, Florida, and presented on Flare. In this presentation, he talks about the real story behind RoboHelp and Macromedia/Adobe (this blew my mind). He also provides a lot of inside detail on Flare.</p>

<ul>
<li>Importing and exporting Flare projects (more impressive than you might think)</li>
<li>One major limitation of Robohelp with single-sourcing when it comes to indexes (oh man, I wish I knew this earlier)</li>
<li>Flare's visual XML editor (nice)</li>
<li>Modifying lists and tables by manipulating structure bars with Flare's editor (the technical writer's dream)</li>
<li>Flare's undockable panes and customization of the workspace (potentially very powerful, especially if you have two monitors)</li>
<li>The powerful and robust style editor in Flare (truly awesome in scope)</li>
<li>Madcap Mimic and its purpose, especially in comparison to Captivate (intriguing about the file sizes)</li>
<li>Madcap Capture and its special layering of images (interesting feature)</li>
</ul>
