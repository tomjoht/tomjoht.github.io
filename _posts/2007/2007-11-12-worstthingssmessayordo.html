<p>In this podcast, I interview Brenda Huettner about strategies for overcoming the top 10 Worst Things SMEs Say or Do. The top 10 list includes the following:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li><em>The user will know how to do this. Do not worry about it.</em></li>
<li><em>I just do not have time to review all of this.</em></li>
<li><em>Oh, I will just write it myself (and then it is awful/useless, and they get insulted if you try to correct or fix it)</em></li>
<li><em>Documentation is not necessary, the interface is obvious.</em></li>
<li><em>I cannot give you access to this …</em></li>
<li>Is generally mean/nasty and rude to you. You have no rapport with them.</li>
<li>Keeps him or herself unavailable to you, or is evasive and rarely present to help you with the information you need.</li>
<li>Gives you explanations, but goes extremely fast and falls into masses of acronyms and other jargon. Or, gives you a screen demo, but blows so fast through the application that you can't follow it. Then is impatient when you ask for slower instructions, or for them to repeat something.</li>
<li>Promises to review the document, but never does, or does so only superficially, noting typos.</li>
<li>Forgets to tell you about changes to the application that affect documentation.</li>
</ol>
