<p>Paul comments on STC's new chapter funding model, which he says is based on the zero-based budgeting model. Paul also offers some rationale behind the startling STC attrition rate (membership dropped from 20,000 members in 2000 to 14,000 members in 2007). He also explains why interacting with the brain trust of the IDL SIG provides the greatest value for him.</source></audio></p>
