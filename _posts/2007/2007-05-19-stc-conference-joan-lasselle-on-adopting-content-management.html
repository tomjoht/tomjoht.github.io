<p>Joan, from Lasselle-Ramsay, gives tips for adopting content management, and explains one of the biggest mistakes people make: choosing the tool first and then trying to make it fit their organization's needs. Joan also talks about how to measure success with CMS projects, and how to determine whether your organization needs a CMS.</source></audio></p>
