<p><a title="Freeconferencing from LiveOffice" href="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/2007/04/freeconferencing.gif"><img title="Freeconferencing from LiveOffice" src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/freeconferencing1.gif" alt="Freeconferencing from LiveOffice" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" /></a>I've been experimenting with a free conference call recording/podcasting service called <a title="FreeConferencing from LiveOffice" href="http://freeconferencing.liveoffice.com/" target="_blank">FreeConferencing from LiveOffice</a> — free if you don't mind calling long-distance to Minnesota, U.S.A., that is. Most people have free long-distance with their cell phone plans. Or even if you don't have free long distance, you can use Skype and get long distance for nearly free.</p>
<p>What's cool about this service is that it allows you to record the conversations. You just click a button that says "Start Recording," and then an hour after the phone call, you log in to a web interface, download the recorded call in MP3 format, and voila, you've got a conference call podcast. This could be very handy for podcasters who want to interview but lack equipment. Or more likely, for those virtual meetings where not everyone is present.</p>
<p>Last week, we had an STC chapter conference call with our student liaisons, but one couldn't attend because she was traveling. So I recorded the call, then posted it on our chapter blog under a password-protected page. When the liaison returned to town, she listened to the entire call and was completely up to speed with the issues discussed.</p>
<p>On Tech Writer Voices, I also <a title="Podcast on Tech Writer Voices " href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2007/04/29/managingvirtualteams/" target="_blank">recorded a podcast with several participants</a> — Char, Brenda, and Kit — on their new book, <a title="Managing Virtual Teams" href="http://www.wordware.com/wiki/" target="_blank">Managing Virtual Teams:</a> Getting the Most from Wikis, Blogs, and Other Collaborate Tools. The podcast went well except that I myself don't have a landline phone, so I used my cell and I sounded very cell-phoney. Oh well. Maybe next time I'll use Skype.</p>
<p>The audio levels of the participants weren't the same, so I had to <a title="The Levelator, from Gigavox Media" href="http://www.gigavox.com/levelator" target="_blank">levelate it.</a> The Levelator tool does wonders to balance audio, but at times leaves a rushing waterfall sound. Still, that's better than having your audience constantly adjusting the audio levels. I hope you enjoy the podcast.</p>
