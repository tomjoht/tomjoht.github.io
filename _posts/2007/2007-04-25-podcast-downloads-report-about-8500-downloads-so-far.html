<p><a href="https://idratherbewriting.com" title="Tech Writer Voices" target="_blank">Tech Writer Voices</a> episodes have been downloaded about 8,500 times so far. If I interviewed you at some point and you're curious about the downloads, see this <a href="{{site.media}}/2007/04/podtracmeasurementreports.pdf" title="Podtrac report">Podtrac report</a>. I have a special <a href="http://podtrac.com" title="Podtrac" target="_blank">Podtrac </a>redirect code on each file that allows me to measure downloads.</p>
