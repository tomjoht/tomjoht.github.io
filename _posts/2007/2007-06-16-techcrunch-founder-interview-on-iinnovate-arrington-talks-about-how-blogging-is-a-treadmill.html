Arrington says blogging can be <a target="_blank" href="http://www.glumbert.com/media/japtreadmill" title="funny treadmill video">like a treadmill</a> rather than a train — the treadmill (blog) just requires more and more content without really going anywhere. He actually says blogging is not a good business. Each day you have to generate new, interesting content for your blog to keep readers coming back.</p>
<p>The best kinds of businesses are network-related, such as <a target="_blank" href="http://digg.com" title="Digg">Digg.com</a>, where users generate the content. In this model, each new user who comes to your site adds value. Because the content is user-generated, it frees up your time to begin other startups or to grow your business in other ways.</p>
<p>For those wanting to be mentioned on Tech Crunch, he says your product or service should be so good that it speaks for itself. If you have to spend a lot of time marketing it, the product probably isn't that good. News of killers apps and services travels fast and doesn't require extensive marketing.</p>

<p>When choosing a vocation, Arrington says to pursue something you're passionate about. If you want to be successful, it's going to require a lot of time and energy — perhaps 15-hour days. If you're not passionate about the endeavor, you'll have a hard time spending a lot of time doing it.</p>
<p>Because Michael Arrington is a big-name blogger (he has nearly 500K subscribers to his Tech Crunch), he receives a lot of criticism from readers — approximately 30-40 criticisms a day. Some are merited, he says, while many others are nasty. Receiving one or two of these messages isn't the same as receiving 30-40 daily. The effect of 30-40 criticisms a day is magnifying, and it has hardened him. Now he looks past criticism and it doesn't bother him as much, but it did change his personality.</p>
<p>In addition to Tech Crunch, Arrington also has a podcast called <a target="_blank" href="http://talkcrunch.com/" title="Talk Crunch">TalkCrunch</a>.</p>
