<p>I stumbled across a <a href="http://www.z-oc.com/" title="http://www.z-oc.com/" target="_blank">well-designed WordPress blog</a> yesterday. It has several qualities that make it stand out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ample white space</li>
<li>Simplicity of design</li>
<li>Contrast between headers and paragraphs</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.z-oc.com/" target="_blank" title="Nicely designed WordPress blog — White Space"><img src="{{site.media}}/whitespace1.gif" alt="Nicely designed WordPress blog — White Space" height="332" width="572" /></a></p>
<p>The ample white space and openness of the design is what I like the most. The cat in the upper-left corner (is it a cat?) and the author's picture on the right also provides a nice balance.</p>
<p>Ample white space is a key principle of graphic design. I think often times we tend to jam layouts with as much text and graphics as possible, using all available space. In contrast, almost every time I see something designed by a graphic artist, the text is not crowding the space. Rather, the abundant white space draws the reader's focus to the text.</p>
