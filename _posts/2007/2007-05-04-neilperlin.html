<p>Neil Perlin, a well-known figure in the tech comm world, now has a blog at <a href="http://www.hyperword.blogspot.com" title="Neil Perlin's blog" target="_blank">www.hyperword.blogspot.com</a>.</p>

<p>Neil's also giving away some pre-defined Flare stylesheets. He says,</p>
<blockquote><p>Flare's stylesheet editor is very powerful but can be intimidating at first, so my stylesheet's purpose is to help people get comfortable with the editor.  This stylesheet, and a document that explains how to use it and discusses styles in general, are available at <a href="http://www.hyperword.com/FlareStylesheet.htm" title="Flare Stylesheets" target="_blank">www.hyperword.com/FlareStylesheet.htm</a></p></blockquote>

You can spend days just configuring the granularity of your styles — one stylesheet for online help, another stylesheet for print, and so on. I'm glad Neil has made some stylesheets people can use who don't want to configure their own.</p>
