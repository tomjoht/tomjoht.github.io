<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/download/" title="WordPress 2.2" target="_blank">WordPress 2.2</a> is definitely worth the upgrade. After my <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2007/05/22/backup-and-restore-wordpress/" title="backup and restore" target="_blank">backup and restore issues</a> the other night, I had a problem-free upgrade this time. The wp-cache plugin was what threw a monkey wrench in the upgrade before. Is WordPress 2.2 worth it? Yes. Here's why:</p>

<p>In previous versions, WordPress let you pull the trigger on a loaded gun. You might activate a plugin that ends up crashing your blog. Now they've made it foolproof by preventing fatal errors from executing.</p>
<p>What plugin was I activating, you ask? Widgets. They are no longer needed because widgets are now integrated into the core -- very smart move.  These two moves (fatal error prevention and widget integration) contribute to usability and lessen the learning curve.</p>
<p>Other than that, here are some other new features of WordPress 2.2:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can deactivate all plugins at once.</li>
<li>On the Comments tab, you can see the title of the post the comment belongs to.</li>
<li>You can choose to display your categories as a drop-down list.</li>
<li>It seems quite a bit faster browsing and loading the pages on the administrative end.</li>
<li>The feed has Atom support.</li>
<li>The More tag works better.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also import from Blogger. So if you started your blog in Blogger because you just wanted an easy lift-off into the blogosphere, but now feel that you need a more powerful tool, you can move to WordPress with an easy import.</p>
<p>Here's the full list of features from <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_2.2" title="WordPress 2.2" target="_blank">WordPress 2.2 release notes</a>.</p>
<h3>A Vista vs. WordPress Reflection</h3>
<p>I've had Vista at work now for a month. While I like the new OS, I can't say it's that life-changing. Mostly it's just doing the same things a little different way. I get much more excited about WordPress upgrades. The tools do completely different things, granted. And I am fond of Vista. Still, somehow WordPress has an allure that has captured me. It's more than software -- it's joining a revolution. Vista is just a Microsoft product.</p>
<p>I once saw a Microsoft ad for Vista that said, "The Next 8 Hours Are Going to Be Very, Very Different." That's totally true, but after those 8 hours are up, uhm, the wow dies down. All the wow quiets down except for the RSS feedreader gadget, which is totally distracting, addicting, and fed by tools like WordPress.</p>
