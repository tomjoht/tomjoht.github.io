Duration: 45 min.</p>
<p>Last week I had a good conversation with Scott and Aaron from DMN Communications about the value of blogging and podcasting. Although this is a DMN Communications podcast, they allowed me to post the audio on Tech Writer Voices as well. (If you are not already subscribed to DMN Communication feed, <a href="http://dmn.podbean.com/2007/11/12/are-you-hurting-your-career-by-not-blogging-and-podcasting/" target="_blank" title="DMN podcast">see their site here</a>.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>During this 45 minute podcast, we talk about myths, rewards, trends, tips, and issues surrounding blogging and podcasting, especially in terms of how it affects your career. It's more of a conversation than an interview. I hope you enjoy it.</source></audio></p>
