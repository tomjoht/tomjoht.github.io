<p>Here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li>It contains both audio and text. You can control the audio easily, or just read the text.</li>
<li>Each page is short (2 minutes) so your attention span doesn't time out.</li>
<li>While you listen to the audio, you look at a graphic that demonstrates the concept explained.</li>
<li>You can see your progress through the course so you can see how many more screens are left.</li>
<li>After 10 screens or so, you're given a quiz. Responses appear after each answer.</li>
<li>After the quizzes, you have files to download and steps to walk through yourself. This helps you not just follow steps, but actually learn and grasp the material.</li>
<li>Some graphics are mini-demos you can watch.</li>
<li>The information is chunked and kept somewhat simple so it's not overwhelming.</li>
<li>At the end of the course, you receive a quick reference card to help you remember what you learned.</li>
<li>You also have the opportunity to rate the course and give feedback.</li>
</ul>
