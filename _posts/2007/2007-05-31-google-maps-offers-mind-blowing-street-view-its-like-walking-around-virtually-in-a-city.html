<p>Google Maps now offers a street view to major cities on their maps. It's like there are 360 degree web cams set up all over major cities -- you can virtually explore them, cruising up and down streets. It's simply amazing. Check it out.The only disappointment is that more cities aren't available in the street view. I think right now it's limited to San Francisco, New York, Denver, Las Vegas, and Miami.</p>
<p>Watch <a title="Google Maps Street View" href="http://maps.google.com/help/maps/streetview/index.html" target="_blank">this video</a> for a two-minute explanation. I've been street viewing New York City for the past little while. Man, I miss that place. I was so creative and alive there. That was before I sold my soul to technical writing. Do a virtual tour walking down Broadway in NYC. Here are a few street view pictures:</p>
<p><a title="Times Square" href="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/2007/05/timessquare.jpg"><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/timessquare1.jpg" alt="Times Square" width="403" height="224" /></a><br />
Times Square, the craziest, most visually stimulating place on earth</p>
<p><a title="Broadway" href="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/2007/05/broadway.jpg"><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/broadway1.jpg" alt="Broadway" width="405" height="249" /></a><br />

<p>Looking at these pictures reminds me of the time when I had creative writing foremost in my mind. What happened to that? Wow, it's like I'm remembering who I used to be ...</p>
<p>I guess I realized I needed to make a living, and technical writing (after a two-year teaching stint at the American Univ. in Cairo) is where I ended up. But looking back at New York makes me rethink my decision. Maybe I should be a tech writer by day, essayist by night.</p>
