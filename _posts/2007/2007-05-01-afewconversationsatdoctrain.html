<p>While I was at Doc Train, I recorded a few brief podcasts with several people. Unfortunately I had some microphone issues so the sound quality isn't good. But you can still hear them. I talked with experts on user personas, data conversion, and simplified technical English.</p>
<p>I talked with Joan LaSalle of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lr.com/" title="LaSalle-Ramsey">Lasselle-Ramsay</a> about user personas, ethnographies, and user-centered design.</p>

<p>I also talked with Don Bridges of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dclab.com/default.asp">Data Conversion Laboratory</a>, about how he converts large amounts of data into XML and other formats.</p>

<p>I also talked with Berry Braster of <a href="http://www.Tedopres.com">TedoPres</a> about controlled English and the importance of simplicity and clarity.</p>

<p>You may have to point your ears to make out all the voices in these recordings, particularly in the last one, where staff was actually taking down our conference room. All of these people were super interesting, and I will have to do a full-length podcast with them at some future time. This was also my first attempt to record people live at a conference. It's quite fun to do this, but I might need to invest in an expensive Edirol recorder to get the sound quality I want.</source></audio></source></audio></source></audio></p>
