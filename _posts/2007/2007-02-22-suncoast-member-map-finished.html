<p>The Suncoast Member mashup map is finished. Several people commented how cool it is.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://stc-suncoast.org/map.html"><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/map1.gif" alt="member map" /></a></p>
<p>You can create a mashup map in 5 minutes from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.batchgeocode.com/">http://www.batchgeocode.com/</a>, and there are Google plugins for WordPress that also facilitate the map. But I used the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/apis/maps/">Google Map API</a> because I wanted a list of scrollable names on the side. The method was much more arduous (right-click the map file to view the source and see the code for the individual markers).</p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure what the map tells us. I introduced the map along with a date for a <a target="_blank" href="http://stc-suncoast.org/chat">member chat</a>. I'm hoping the map will give more context to the remotely located chatters. If nothing else, it's interesting to see where everyone is located.</p>
