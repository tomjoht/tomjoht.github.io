<p>If you have a web host, like <a target="_blank" href="http://bluehost.com/" title="Blue Host">Blue Host</a>, you can have different domains (called add-on domains) that point to different subdirectories within your host account. In this post I explain how to set this up. It's a bit confusing and I've never seen instructions on configuring this.</p>
<p>Let's say I want to have two sites, one called johndoe.com and the other janedoe.com, and I only want to have one web host. The root domain of the web host could be anything, such as www.idratherbewriting.com (my domain). To set this up, here's the basic procedure:</p>
<ol>
<li>Call up your web host and register two add-on domains, such as johndoe.com and janedoe.com. It may cost $10 or so to register them. Then it takes a day to kick in. Of course these add-on domains need to be available domains. I'm using johndoe and janedoe as generic examples.</li>
<li>Tell them to point johndoe.com to subdirectory idratherbewriting.com/johndoe. Point janedoe.com to subdirectory idratherbewriting.com/janedoe.</li>
<li>Now go into your host's cPanel, and use Fantastico to install WordPress in the two add-on domains. In the Install in Domain drop-down box, select johndoe.com.<em> Leave the Install in Directory field blank.</em> The fields should appear as follows:</li>
</ol>
<ol><img src="{{site.media}}/subdirectory1.gif" alt="subdirectory installation" title="subdirectory installation" /></ol>
<p>When WordPress installs, the add-on domain folder will appear in the public_html folder in your file directory. So if you access your file directory via FileZilla (or some other FTP program), and then go to /public_html, you'll see a folder called johndoe. That's where your WordPress files are installed.</p>
{% include ads.html %}
<p>Within the WordPress admin dashboard, go to the Options tab and you will see that your add-on domain appears in both the WordPress URL and the Blog address (URL) fields.</p>
<p><a href="{{site.media}}/2007/06/options.png" title="Options"><img src="{{site.media}}/options.png" alt="Options" /></a></p>
<p>You can log into your add-on domain blog by going to johndoe.com/wp-admin.</p>
<p>Users will be able to go to johndoe.com and janedoe.com and navigate them without realizing that they are really subdirectories under idratherbewriting.com.</p>
<p>Special thanks to Ryan at BlueHost tech support for walking me through this. Support at BlueHost is excellent, which is probably why they're at the <a target="_blank" href="http://wordpress.org/hosting/" title="WordPress Recommended Hosts">top of the recommended hosts list </a>at WordPress.</p>
