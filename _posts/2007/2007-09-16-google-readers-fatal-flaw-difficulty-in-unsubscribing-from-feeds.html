<p>You can unsubscribe from feeds in Google Reader via the Feed Management page (see image below), but it's not the most efficient way of managing the feeds.<img width="496" src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/readerexample21.png" alt="Subscription Management page — tedious to use" height="234" /></p>
<p>Using this method to unsubscribe can be tedious and time-consuming, because you have to leave the page you're on and then scroll down to find the feed you want to unsubscribe from.</p>
<p>Instead, to unsubscribe from feeds in Google Reader:</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. Assuming you're reading feeds from the All Items view, where all feeds are aggregated and sorted only by date, click the post title to expand the view.</p>

<p>2. Click the name of the feed as it appears next to the word "from."</p>

<p>3. Click the <strong>Feed settings</strong> button and select <strong>Unsubscribe</strong>.</p>

<p>Thanks Reed for the tip.</p>
