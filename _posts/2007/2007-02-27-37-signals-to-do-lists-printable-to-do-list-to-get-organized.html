<p><a href="http://www.tadalist.com/" target="_blank">37 Signals' to-do lists</a>, which offer printable to-do lists online to help you get organized, or to simply make lists, is one of the most useful tools I've used lately. Although I didn't write favorably about <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2007/02/27/my-first-virtual-administrative-meeting/" target="_blank">37 Signal's Campfire chat product</a>, I really recommend their to-do lists. Mainly, all their products are cool, but the to-do lists have a special place in my heart because they are totally free.</p>
<p>I use these to-do lists when I'm online (75% of my day) and I think of something I need to do. For example, if I think, oh, that'd be a cool blog post, or heck, I need to do X for the Suncoast chapter, or shoot, I need to run this errand, I click a quicklink to my to-do list (which for some dumb reason is named ta-da list), and within about 3 seconds I can jot down my thought. It's really a functional list system.</p>
<p>Here's an example of a list I started today:</p>

<p>You can make the lists private or public. You can also share your lists with specific people. Your list can also have an RSS feed.</p>
<p>I even made <a href="http://suncoast.tadalist.com/lists/all" target="_blank">a bunch of lists for the Suncoast chapter</a>, which I hoped members would maintain, but it didn't really take off. Having two distinct logins doesn't quite work.</p>
<p>One of the strengths of 37 Signals is their philosophy about simplicity. I was listening to a <a href="http://www.brianoberkirch.com/?p=724" target="_blank">podcast by a 37 Signals developer Jason Freid</a>, and he said they maintain the idea that simple applications are actually more flexible. They serve a wider range of purposes and appeal to a broader audience. Plus what's easy to use, gets used.</p>
