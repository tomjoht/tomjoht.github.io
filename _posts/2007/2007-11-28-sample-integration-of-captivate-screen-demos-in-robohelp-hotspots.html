<p><a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/robohelp/help/index.htm" target="_blank"><img src="{{site.media}}/sampledemo1.png" alt="Sample Integration of Captivate with RoboHelp" align="right" /></a>I made a help file showing a <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/robohelp/help/index.htm" target="_blank">sample integration of Captivate with Robohelp</a>, specifically showing screen demos inside hotspots. I like that the screen demos hide so nicely.</p>
<p>(The content of the demos is not what I'm showing here, but if you're totally new to Audacity, you might find them helpful as a basic intro.) Let me know if you have any feedback.</p>
