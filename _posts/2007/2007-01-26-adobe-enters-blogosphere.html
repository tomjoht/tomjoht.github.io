<p><a target="_blank" href="http://scriptorium.com/palimpsest/">Sarah O'Keefe</a> just told me the news: Adobe has joined the blogosphere. More importantly, the RoboHelp development team just started a blog: <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/techcomm/">http://blogs.adobe.com/techcomm/</a></p>
<p><img src="{{site.media}}/adobe-blog.gif" alt="adobe-blog.gif" /></p>
<p>This is one of the best moves Adobe has made. I guess I was too impatient with my comments on their inaccessibility in <a target="_blank" href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2007/01/25/adobe-seminar-nice-connection-and-demo-but-questions-were-filtered/">my last post</a>. It will be interesting to see how many people use their blog as an access point to provide feedback, recommendations, and comments.</p>
<p>With Vivek's <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.adobe.com/techcomm/2007/01/my_first_post.html">first post</a>, I see that the blog has the comment-moderation feature turned on. But hey, maybe that won't prove to be an issue.</p>
<p>I also see that they are using <a target="_blank" href="http://movabletype.com">Movable Type</a> as the blogging platform. For enterprise-wide blogging, Movable Type is the dominant platform. WordPress came out with their first edition of <a target="_blank" href="http://mu.wordpress.org/">WordPress Multi User edition</a>), but it is in infancy compared with Movable Type's enterprise edition. Movable Type might have cornered the blogging market had they not switched to a paid model and if their blogs were easier to install.</p>
