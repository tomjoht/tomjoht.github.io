<p><a href="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/2007/04/jott.gif" title="Jott"><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/jott1.gif" title="Jott" alt="Jott" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" /></a>I just discovered <a href="http://jott.com" title="Jott" target="_blank">Jott </a>today. Jott transcribes voicemail you leave on its service as text, and then sends that text to you via e-mail. So if you're driving along and you have a memo to note, instead of writing it down, you just call a special Jott toll-free number, speak your memo, and Jott transcribes it as text and e-mails it to you.</p>
<p>You can also "jot" voicemail transcribed memos to others you've added to your Jott contact list. It's a cool service, but when I cranked up a podcast and tried to record an excerpt of it as a memo, Jott couldn't understand the speech. Darn. But if you speak into the phone clearly, it transcribes it rather well. For example, here's a jot I made tonight:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Shannon its Tom, please save me a couple of cookies I will be back in about  half an hour and I might get a movie or not, I am sending you this voice mail,  which will be converted to text in your inbox, arriving in about five or ten  minutes. Bye, love you. [...]. Bye, bye.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you don't mind a few comma splices in the transcription, it's a great resource. Also, Jott is in beta right now, so everything is free.</p>
