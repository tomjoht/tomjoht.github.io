<p>You can now list your blog in a technical writing blog directory at <a href="http://www.techwriterblogs.com/">www.techwriterblogs.com</a>. (I just set this up with a wiki.) If you're a technical writer/communicator and you blog, or if your blog contains information of interest to technical writers, please list it on the wiki by clicking the <strong>Edit this Page</strong> button in the upper-left corner (see image below). Then just follow the example formatting of the first entry. After one week I'll combine the feeds into an <acronym title="Outline Processor Markup Language">OPML</acronym> file and a Yahoo pipes feed.</p>
<p>* After you add your blog details, please write a post on your blog lettings others know about the directory.</p>
