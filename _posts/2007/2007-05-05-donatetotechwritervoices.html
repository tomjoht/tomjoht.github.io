<p><a href="http://www.zzounds.com/item--EDIR09" target="_blank" title="Edirol R-09 Recorder"><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/edirol1.jpg" alt="Edirol R-09 Recorder" title="Edirol R-09 Recorder" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" /></a>The STC Conference in Minneapolis this year will be a good experience for all those who attend. But for the thousands who can't make the trip, they'll be left out. I'd like to record podcasts live from the STC Conference—talking with speakers, participants, consultants, and vendors. These podcasts will have an impact on the thousands of communicators who can't attend the conference because they live too far away.</p>
<p>The Tech Writer Voices podcast has affected the lives of technical writers across the world. For example, yesterday I received an e-mail from a listener that made me feel especially good. Dian K. of Denmark writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>I just want to say how much I appreciate Tech Writer Voices. I'm not an independent, but there aren't any other technical writers here at Intermate — and the nearest STC chapters are UK and TransAlpine. Tech Writer Voices makes me feel as if I actually have colleagues in a way that web sites, discussion groups, blogs, user communities, etc. never have.</p></blockquote>
<p>I dedicate a lot of time to producing the podcasts for Tech Writer Voices because I know it provides value to the global technical writer community.</p>
<p>Good audio recording equipment — the kind that creates crisp, clear audio — is relatively inexpensive (for example, the Edirol recorder above starts at $400). To help defray equipment and bandwidth costs of the podcast, I've set up a way for listeners and other supporters <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/donate">to donate to Tech Writer Voices</a>.</p>
<p>If you would like to donate, <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/donate">go to this page</a> and click the <strong>Donate </strong>button. You'll be taken to a PayPal page. You can enter any donation amount in the Price field. Then scroll down and click the <strong>Continue</strong> button to donate by Visa or Mastercard.</p>
<p>I will be recognizing and thanking those who donate by adding their names to a Members page on the podcast site. The Spring Membership Campaign will close on May 11th, 2007.</p>
<p>For all those who donate, thank you! And for those who support the podcast by simply being a listener, thank you too.</p>
