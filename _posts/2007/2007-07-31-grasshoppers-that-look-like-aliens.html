<p><strong>June 2008 Update:</strong> I know you probably found this post by searching for the word Grasshopper. Feel free to save this grasshopper image and use it however you want. I don't know the official name of the grasshopper, but I took the photo in St. Petersburg, Florida. I then removed the background in Photoshop. If you know the specific species name of this grasshopper, let me know.</p>
<p>This beautiful grasshopper was hanging out on our patio wall all last night. I was able to get about a foot away and take this picture. The grasshoppers in Florida are gigantic.</p>

<p>Then we had some fun with photoshop. Notice how Lucy tries to save Avery.<br />
