<p><a target="_blank" href="http://google.com/reader" title="Google Reader">Google Reader</a> offers a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/help/reader/sharing.html" title="Shared FAQ">Shared feature</a> that allows you to share select posts from your list of feeds in Google Reader by simply clicking a <strong>Share </strong>link (see image below). You can then provide your readers with a link to your shared items page as well as your shared items feed. I just added my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/14956448268706131592" title="Shared Items Page">Shared Items page</a> as a link in my header.</p>
