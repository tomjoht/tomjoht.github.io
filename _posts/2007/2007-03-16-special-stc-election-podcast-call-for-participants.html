<p><img vspace="5" align="right" src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/elections1.gif" hspace="5" alt="STC Elections" title="STC Elections" />We're doing a special STC election podcast next Wednesday at 9 p.m. EST, talking with the different candidates running for STC offices. If you're running for election, and you want to talk about yourself and your vision/plans for the STC, contact me at <a target="_blank" href="tomjoht@gmail.com">tomjoht@gmail.com</a>. All you need is a landline phone.</p>
<p>I mentioned this elections topic at the close of my <a target="_blank" href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2007/03/14/tech-writer-voices-podcast-is-technical-writing-boring-tech-writers-as-information-architects/">last podcast.</a>  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nickybleiel.org/">Nicky Bleiel</a> has already contacted me.</p>
<p>I'm curious to see how many candidates are tapped into the blogosphere enough to find this post on their own. Actually, I'm not sure <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stc.org/candidatesFAQ/index.asp">any of the running leaders</a> have blogs. This is a mistake. Blogs are the easiest way leaders can reach out to others, disseminate information, and build relationships. <a target="_blank" href="http://atl-stc-prez.livejournal.com/">Holly Harkness's President's blog</a> for the Atlanta STC is one of the coolest blogs I've seen. It's been great reading the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stc-cdx.org/newsnotes/2007/02">news and notes from Paula Berger</a>, but a blog might have been easier and more powerful.</p>
