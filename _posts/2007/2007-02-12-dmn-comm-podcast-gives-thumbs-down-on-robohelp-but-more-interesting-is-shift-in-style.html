<p><a href="http://dmn.podbean.com/2007/02/11/weighing-in-on-robohelp-6/" target="_blank">DMN Communication's latest podcast</a> is well-worth listening to. It is by far their best podcast to date. They've moved from a scripted style to one that is more natural and conversational. They also lengthened it to 16 minutes. I really enjoyed listening to them talk about their honest thoughts about RoboHelp 6 (which, by the way, they give a thumbs down.)</p>
<p>They've also embedded the Podbean player directly into their blog posts.  Overall, excellent job with your podcast, Aaron and Scott. I am really enjoying it. <img src="{{site.media}}/podbean.gif" alt="podbean" /></p>
<p>I <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2007/01/10/recording-your-chapter-presentations/" target="_blank">also hear </a>that the <a href="http://www.stcatlanta.org/" target="_blank">Atlanta chapter </a>is starting to podcast their meetings. This is getting excitingâ€”if you've been contemplating podcasting, jump in. The easiest way is to start recording your own chapter's presentations. We actually have a talk by <a href="http://stc.org/about/staff/staff03.asp" target="_blank">Susan Burton </a>that we're going to post soon that will absolutely blow your mind.</p>
<p>I don't have anything new to add to the RoboHelp discussion, other than to point out that Adobe's RJ Racquez is reaching out to users and <a href="http://monkeypi.net/?p=150" target="_blank">offers his phone number </a>as a contact point to discuss any concerns.</p>
