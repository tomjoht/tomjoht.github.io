I attended a DITA workshop Alan gave at the Doc Train conference in Vancouver and really enjoyed it. He definitely knows what he's talking about, and he is a regular listener of <a title="Tech Writer Voices" href="https://idratherbewriting.com" target="_blank">Tech Writer Voices</a>. I'm excited to see him in the blogosphere—be sure to subscribe to his feed.</p>
