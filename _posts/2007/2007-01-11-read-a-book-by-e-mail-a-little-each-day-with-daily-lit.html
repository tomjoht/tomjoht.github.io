<p><a href="http://dailylit.com" target="_blank">Daily Lit</a> is designed for those people who spend so much time reading e-mail, blogs, and other things online that they never have enough time to read. It's really simple: You just choose a title, the frequency with which you want to read it, and your e-mail. I can see how this might become a really popular service.</p>

<p>By the way, I heard about Daily Lit on the <a href="http://revision3.com/diggnation" target="_blank">Diggnation podcast</a>. <a href="http://digg.com/software/Can_t_Find_the_Time_to_Read_a_Book_Do_it_By_Email" target="_blank">Digg</a> is one of the best tech news sites out there — I have it set as my home page.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://revision3.com/diggnation" target="_blank">Diggnation podcast</a> consists of two tech savvy guys who talk about the most dug topics on Digg. They can really be funny sometimes -- they comment on the articles, giving their own thoughts and evaluations.</p>
