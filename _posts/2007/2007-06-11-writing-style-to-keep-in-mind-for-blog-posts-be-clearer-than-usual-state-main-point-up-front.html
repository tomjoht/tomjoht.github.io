<blockquote><p><strong>The average person only comprehends 60% of what they read</strong>. ....</p>
<p>To ensure your reader â€˜gets' what you're saying you need to make it clear by using some of the following techniques.</p>
<p>- <strong>Use simple language.</strong> Avoid technical jargon.</p>

<p>- <strong>Don't introduce too many ideas in one post.</strong> You can always add another  post later.</p>
<p>- <strong>Start your entry with your main point</strong> in the first paragraph. Better still, incorporate it in your title. (This can also bring more traffic through search engine referrals)</p></blockquote>
<p>You have to be extremely clear in your blog posts, without requiring readers to figure out your point. This seems rather obvious, but it's something I was debating about with Shannon. She likes to "show rather than tell," and often lets her readers discover the meaning that they want from her posts.</p>
<p>This is a carryover from creative writing, and it can be more rewarding in some situations and contexts. In fact, I really enjoy reading her witty posts. But I read blogs by scanning down lists of 150+ blogs aggregated in my feedreader. I love it when headlines are descriptive and first paragraphs hint at the topic. Unfortunately this is only true about 20% of the time.</p>
