<p>Brad, a graduate student in the Rhetoric and Technical Communication program at Iowa State University, talks about the issue of academic knowledge versus real world experience. He says it is importance for technical communicators to be more than scribes. Brad also shares his feedback on RoboHelp 7, and provides tips for students to gain the tool knowledge they need for the workplace.</source></audio></p>
