<p>Someone told me that <a href="http://googletalk.blogspot.com/2006/11/how-to-part-4-voicemail.html#links" target="_blank">Google Talk</a> is clearer than Skype, but how do you record Google Talk conversations? Is there a device that records conversations?</p>
<p>Another matter: See how Google Talk is incorporating screenshot tutorials.</p>

<p>I think that's cool, but the screen quality looks like they've got a video camera looking at the screen. Surely that's not the case, but the resolution is so poor, it's hard to view it with pleasure. But it is delivered via youtube. I think we're going to see all screenshot demos delivered via youtube in the future. I've been wanting to do this, but can't figure out what screen demo application to use that produces mpeg4 formats in small outputs. (Youtube requires that your uploads be under 100 megs and in mpeg4 format.)</p>
<p>Finally, notice that there is not comment feature for their blog. Instead, you simply create a post linking to their post.<br />

<p>I wanted to ask them what tool they were using to capture their screen demos, but the only way to do this is by creating my own post that links to theirs. All of the links to their post appear as comments below the post. The only problem with this is that you have to have a blog to comment on their blog. Maybe they're having trouble with spam?</p>
