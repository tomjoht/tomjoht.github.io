<p>While driving home from the Documentation and Training Conference in Vancouver, B.C., I recorded <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2007/04/30/carcastfromvancouver/" title="Carcast on Tech Writer Voices" target="_blank">my first carcast</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2007/04/30/carcastfromvancouver/" target="_blank" title="Driving Home"><img src="{{site.media}}/drivingflickr1.jpg" title="Driving Home" alt="Driving Home" height="247" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="392" /></a></p>
<p>It was a really interesting experience. I hadn't planned to do a carcast, and then on the way home I was a little bored and thought hey, why not try a carcast? I first heard about carcasting from a carcast Tee Morris did (see episode 3: <a href="http://www.dummies.com/WileyCDA/DummiesTitle/productCd-0471748986,page-1.html" title="Tee Morris carcast" target="_blank">Podcasting on the Go</a>). Carcasting is actually a lot of fun.</p>
<p>And doing it post-conference is perfect, because I had a lot of ideas and thoughts swimming around in my head. The carcast helped me clarify a few things in my mind while providing an entertaining driving activity.</p>

<p>Of course sound quality in a car is not ideal. And I was totally holding the mic too close to my mouth. So it was a learning experience.</p>
<p>On the way home I drove through a little town called Burlington, which is where I grew up. Of course I drove past my old houses, school, and favorite places. That was part of the reason I flew into Seattle rather than straight to Vancouver. I included my reminiscing in the carcast, mixed with my thoughts on the conference.</p>
<p>The scenery in this image is how everything looked, but I didn't have a camera so this is a pic <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/toniphotos/285972076/" title="pic source" target="_blank">from Flickr</a>. I also added some music from <a href="http://www.ceolminers.com" title="Ceol Miner's Band" target="_blank">Harry Miller's Ceol Miner's band</a> at the beginning and end. I visited with Harry while I was in Seattle.</p>
<p>This carcast isn't edited, and the audio quality isn't ideal. Sorry about that. I was just using my little iRiver MP3 player with its built-in mic. If you're ever on a long drive, you might think about trying carcasting. It's actually a lot of fun if you're driving alone.</p>
