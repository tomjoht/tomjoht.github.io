<p>You can advertise your product or service on Tech Writer Voices podcasts. Most podcasts have between 200-300 downloads, with a total audience of 600+ plus subscribers.</p>
<p>I will advertise your product or service on the show for free in exchange for a copy of your product or a period of service. For example, if you make a screen capture program, I will promote your product on the show via commercials or discussion in exchange for a copy of the screen capture program.</p>
<p>By submitting copies of your product as promotional material, you not only gain valuable communication time in front of 600+ dedicated technical communicators around the world, but you also potentially win over one very visible promoter of your product.</p>
<h3>Audience</h3>

Most listeners are based in the United States, but there is also a sizable global audience—in Israel, Australia, Denmark, India, and other countries. When you advertise on this podcast, you can reach a global audience.</p>
<h3>Podcast Lengths</h3>
