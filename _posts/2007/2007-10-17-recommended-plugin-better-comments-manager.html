<p>If you use WordPress and want to streamline the process for responding to comments, check out the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/better-comments-manager/screenshots/" target="_blank">Better Comments Manager plugin</a>. You can respond to all your comments directly from your admin console interface, rather than responding in the comments section below each post. This is one of the more useful plugins out there.</p>
<p>Here's a screenshot of the Better Comments Manager interface:</p>
