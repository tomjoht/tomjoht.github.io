Josh says,</p>
<blockquote><p>Nobody talks about users of dishwashers, or users of retail stores, or users of telephones. So why are we talking about "users" of computers, browsers, and software?</p>
<p>Try, just for a day, to stop using this word. You'll be amazed at how differently you think about the world.</p>
<p>Web users become people looking for information.</p>

<p>Application users become employees trying to get stuff done.</p>
<p>Users of your Web site become customers.</p></blockquote>
<p>I tend to agree. After reading the post, I was talking to someone who mentioned their "users," and I had to laugh a little. When I hear the term, I now think of a drug user or some other addictive person.</p>
