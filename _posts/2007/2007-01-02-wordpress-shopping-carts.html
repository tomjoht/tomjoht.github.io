<p>I created <a href="http://maryoverley.com" target="_blank">a site</a> for a friend who simply wanted some presence on the Internet to publish her essays. Easy enough. I decided to use WordPress as a CMS. I thought I could do it all in about an hour, but then of course I ran into a few snags.</p>
<p>Here are the two main technical snags:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a static home page, and having the blog area available from another link.</li>
<li>Integrating the e-commerce lite shopping cart.</li>
</ul>
<p>The solution to the static home page proved to be pretty simple. The best solution is available is the one on the <a href="http://turbochargedcms.com/2006/11/building-a-true-home-page-into-your-wordpress-blog/" target="_blank">Turbocharged site</a>. However, the specifics of my situation made it tough. I created the site as an add-on domain in a folder directory on my host. Whenever I used the method described on Turbocharge, the .htaccess file kept being overwritten and it caused the site links not to work. This is because I had enabled permalinks. I thought the Turbocharge method was faulty, so I kept looking for alternatives.</p>
<p>The .htaccess file controls how the site reads the pages of the directory. The only solution I found was to disable permalinks. This means the URLs aren't pretty, but I consider it the problem of the add-on domain situation. The guy at Blue Host (my host) said things can easily go haywire with add-on domains.</p>
<p>The second problem was with the <a href="http://www.instinct.co.nz/?p=16" target="_blank">e-commerce lite shopping cart plugin</a>. It seems simple on the surface, but despite the instructions included on one of the tabs, it is not entirely intuitive. I have to remember this when I write instructions: always dumb-down the level lower than you think.</p>
<p>But figuring it out wasn't too difficult after a while. The problem was that after I got everything working, I realized that <a href="http://www.maryoverley.com/?page_id=23" target="_blank">the shopping cart dropped down</a> when the user added products. The cart dropped right over the text of the products themselves! Frustrating. I added some text at the top to fix that. But then I discovered another problem: the cart only worked in Firefox, not IE.</p>
{% include ads.html %}
<p>I later realized that the page parameters within the e-commerce tab didn't have the pages of the add-on domain's URL, and that was why I was getting the empty cart error.</p>
<p>If I could have one WordPress wish, it would be for some brilliant PHP programmer to create a more robust, functional shopping cart for WordPress.</p>
<p>Despite all of these shortcomings, I think once I get the method down, I could create a website with a shopping cart in about an hour. :)</p>
