<p>Jason said Fred Siebert recommends that you find what you're passionate about, and then pursue it online via blogging or other social media. You'll be amazed by the number of people you meet and network with. These people will help take you beyond where you could go yourself. They will help you overcome your weaknesses and broaden your perspective.</p>
<p>Also, Siebert says to follow these three principles with blogging:</p>
<ol>
<li>Post often</li>
<li>Post short</li>
<li>Post with a picture</li>
</ol>
<p>Seth Godin has some of the same points on his post on <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/11/how_to_write_a_.html" target="_blank">how to write a blog post</a>, but adds some more criteria — basically making your posts thought-provoking.</p>
