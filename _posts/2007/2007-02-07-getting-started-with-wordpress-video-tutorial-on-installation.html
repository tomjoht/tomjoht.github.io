<p>I re-recorded the initial WordPress installation demo video tutorial I did <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2007/02/04/installing-wordpress-a-quick-audiovisual-tutorial/">the other day</a>. This one is about three times as long and has a lot more more information. I started out thinking it would be 10 minutes, but it ended up being 30 minutes.</p>
<p>If you're looking to get started with WordPress, this <a href="{{site.media}}/2007/02/installationdemo.html" target="_blank" title="installation demo">Getting Started / installation demo</a> will (sort of) show you how to do it.</p>

<p>I'm still experimenting with screencasting and Blueberry's Flashback Express Recorder, so I consider this practice. In this practice screencast, I reduced the size of the frame and also changed the hertz rate from 22 to 44 to supposedly increase the sound quality (but also the size).</p>

<p>If the volume seems low, go into your control panel and increase your computer's sound properties. Start > Control Panel > Sounds and Audio Devices.</p>
<p>I'm still fumbling around a lot with these. After I finished this screencast, I felt that I should impose a rule about the length of screencasts, limiting them to 10 minutes or less and keeping the focus more narrow. One can only sit so long in front of a computer listening. I'm also trying to add more personality to my narration.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any feedback on the tutorial, let me know. I think the screen movements sometimes get disjointed with the actual audio, but I'm not totally sure. I like that the 65 meg file plays almost instantly when you click it.</p>
