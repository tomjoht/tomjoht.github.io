<p>Trackbacks are one of the most interesting features of blogs. Basically if I write a post that links to another person's post, my comment actually appears in the comments section of that other person's post -- even though I didn't actually make the comment on their site!</p>
<p>Here's an example. I posted a note on my blog saying to check out my latest podcast, which is on idratherbewriting.com. My post actually then appears as an excerpted comment in the comments section of the post I linked to.<br />
<a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2007/01/03/help-20-the-convergence-of-web-20-with-help-documentation/" target="_blank" /><a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2007/01/03/help-20-the-convergence-of-web-20-with-help-documentation/" target="_blank"><img id="image153" alt="trackbacks" src="{{site.media}}/trackback.png" /></a></p>
<p>Additionally, let's say that I just post a link to another person's site. On my admin panel, I see an incoming link from that site. Blogs are more aware of each other than traditional websites.</p>
