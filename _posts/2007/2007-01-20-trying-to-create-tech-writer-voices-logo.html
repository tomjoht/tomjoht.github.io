<p>I've been trying to create a logo for Tech Writer Voices, but I'm not a graphic artist, so my logo looks pretty amateur. </p>
<p>My idea is to have something like this:</p>
<p><img id="image248" src="{{site.media}}/logo.gif" alt="logo ideal" /></p>
<p>The above image comes from <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/patrick_o_d/295269978/">someone's Flickr stream</a>.</p>
<p>But instead of the RSS logo, I thought I'd put in a globe. So I loaded <a href="http://earth.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Earth</a>, captured a globe image, and then inserted it into some headphones that I got off of Microsoft clipart.</p>
{% include ads.html %}
<p><img id="image249" src="{{site.media}}/twvlogo.gif" alt="tech writer voices logo" /></p>
<p>My idea behind using the globe is to emphasize the global nature of the technical writing community. So far, on Tech Writer Voices I've interviewed writers in Australia, India, South Korea, Canada, and the U.S. Listeners are also global. </p>
<p>The logo still doesn't emphasize the technical writer aspect of Tech Writer Voices. What icon symbolizes the technical writer? The old pencil might have once been the symbol of our trade, but I haven't used a pencil regularly for years. </p>
<p>Any ideas? If you have thoughts for the logo, please let me know. I want the image to communicate the focus of the podcast.</p>
