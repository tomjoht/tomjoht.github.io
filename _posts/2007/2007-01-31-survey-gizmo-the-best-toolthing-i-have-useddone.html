<p><img align="right" src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/surveygizmo.gif" alt="surveygizmo" title="surveygizmo" />I have been using <a target="_blank" href="http://surveygizmo.com">SurveyGizmo</a> to issue some short surveys to our chapter and found that the tool is not only the best survey tool I've used, but issuing short surveys is also the best thing I have done. The type of feedback that comes back is amazing, particularly when you leave a free answer essay in there. People usually have feedback, and this gives them an opportunity to provide it.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips for surveys.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep them short. Ask no more than 5 questions.</li>
<li>Provide at least one free answer essay (not just radio buttons).</li>
<li>If you can lighten the survey up, it may be more appreciated.</li>
<li>Share your responses with the same people you surveyed </li>
</ul>
<p>As soon as I close this last survey, I am planning to respond to some of the interesting comments on <a target="_blank" href="http://stc-suncoast.org">the Suncoast blog</a>. This may generate some more discussion on our chapter blog.</p>
<p>On a tool note, I also tried <a target="_blank" href="http://plugins.starkware.net/">SurveyFly</a>, which embeds the survey more easily into your posts. However, I prefer the way SurveyGizmo collects and sorts the information gathered from the survey. It is much easier to read and even <a target="_blank" href="http://www.surveygizmo.com/reports/771/1023/ER5YAMH5Z4A8PC7FLO7IK6H7XB2WIV/">graphs it into rich, colorful reports</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven't extended a survey to your chapter, check out <a target="_blank" href="http://surveygizmo.com">SurveyGizmo</a>. The first 250 responses of any survey are free, and since I never plan to get more than 100 responses from any survey, this tool is perfect for me.</p>
