Duration: 6 min.</p>
<p>The Chicago chapter won a prestigious chapter of distinction award this year (they won the award at their membership level, 301 to 600 members). Dan, the chapter's treasurer, talks about a critical turning point in their chapter, in which they moved from a point of dependent frustration to independent liberation. In addition to learning to act for themselves, Dan also talks about their chapter's impromptu meetings.</source></audio></p>
