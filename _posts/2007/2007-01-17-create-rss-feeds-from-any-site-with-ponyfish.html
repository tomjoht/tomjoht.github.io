<p>Ponyfish allows you to create an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(file_format)">RSS feed</a> for sites that don't have them. If your favorite site is constantly maintained and updated, and there's no feed for it, just enter the URL into Ponyfish, configure it a little by clicking your mouse on the site's links, and Ponyfish will create a feed for you.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ponyfish.com"><img src="{{site.media}}/ponyfish.gif" id="image228" alt="ponyfish" /></a></p>
<p>It's a little hard to believe that it actually works, but apparently there is quite a buzz about it. The user interface is fairly simple. You just click all the links on the page, and Ponyfish begins tracking changes to the content from those paths.</p>
<p><a href="http://ponyfish.com"><img src="{{site.media}}/ponyfishdemo.gif" id="image229" alt="ponyfish demo" /></a></p>
<p>For example, the <a href="http://stc-orlando.org/">Orlando STC site </a>is one that I wish had an RSS feed. Their site is really informative, but it lacks the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(file_format)">RSS feed</a>. How do I know when information has been added or updated? Does someone have to send me an e-mail, cluttering up my inbox?</p>
<p>Hence the concept of the feed. Let me know if you've used <a href="http://www.ponyfish.com">Ponyfish </a>with success.</p>
