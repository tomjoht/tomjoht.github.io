<p><img src="{{site.media}}/sleep200.jpg" title="sleep deprivation" alt="sleep deprivation" align="left" hspace="5" />This <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6894556&amp;ft=2&amp;f=1090" target="_blank">NPR story of the day</a> hit home. It's about how teens stay up too late because of the Facebook, MySpace, instant messenger, and other web allurements that are so enticing. Then they wake up in the morning and check their e-mail and poof, an hour goes by and they're already late for school.</p>
<p>I often have the same problem -- so my wife has taken the role of the bedtime enforcer. At 9:45 p.m. she turns the computer off for me. My life is so sad sometimes.</p>
