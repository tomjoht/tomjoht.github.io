My daughter and her school are at a pivotal moment: she has the opportunity to potentially gain admission to a STEM program next year, one that would put her into the high-achieving track with other future-bound students looking to enter science/technology/engineering/math careers. 

While she's eager to get into the program, only about 50% of the kids who apply get accepted. As I've been thinking about ways to help her persuade the admissions group that she's a good fit, I asked another parent for tips. She said the applicants need to be "authentic," she said. The kids have to want to earnestly enter the program on their own accord, not just because their parents push them into it. 

My 11-year-old is authentically interested, I'm sure. Like most kids, math isn't necessarily her favorite subject, but she has always showed an interest in science, from capturing bugs to doing science projects to putting together kits to experimenting with recipes in the kitchen, she loves science.

But here's the challenge: how does she convince an admissions panel of her interest in science? From the application process and interviews, many kids will likely look the same. Good grades, professed interest in the sciences, proper motivation, etc. 

Here's my plan: I'm going to recommend that my daughter start a curiosity journal. It's not enough to simply say you're curious. Unless you can capture some of your curiosity in a way that others can see, read, and assess for themselves, perhaps in some interesting journal entries on a site, how will they be persuaded that you possess authentic curiosity toward science?

This strategy got me thinking about my own career. I think I'm a pretty good technical writer, with a solid understanding about how to write good documentation. But am I really *better* than other technical writers with the equivalent or more experience, who are also tech and web savvy with good writing and people skills? Not really. 

The trick is that I am better at persuading others of my capabilities, because they can read about it on my blog. I'm pretty sure it was my post [What is the technical writer's role in content marketing?](https://idratherbewriting.com/2016/01/04/content-marketing-to-the-rescue-for-thought-leadership/) that persuaded a senior hiring manager over to me when I applied at Amazon. I've had similar experiences when I applied for other jobs. People read my blog or listen to my podcasts, get a glimpse of my awareness and sensibility, make a connection, and then feel I'm a good fit for the job. 

Even if I'm really no better than anyone else, I show evidence of my knowledge through my blog, and that is what opens doors. My blog convinces them I'm a rockstar.

Will a curiosity journal be enough to persuade a panel of admissions advisors that my daughter has the right curiosity for science? Will she be able to write persuasively enough, in a way that wins over her audience? I hope so. 

Not too long ago, I was helping my wife prepare some material for her Stanford admissions application. To gather material, we took out our old college keepsakes and other notebooks to remind us of experiences we had in writing classes, honors programs, and other classes. As I was looking through this bin of keepsakes, I found some of my old journals and realized that all through high school I'd been keeping a journal. 

I'm not sure when or why I started. Maybe an English teacher at some point encouraged me to start a journal? But sure enough, I have been writing journal entries off and on since I was a teenager. When I saw this pattern of journal writing, it suddenly clicked why I started a blog and kept at it all these years -- nothing resembles journal writing in this day and age so closely as a blog. A blog is literally a "web log" or online journal.

I attribute much of my career success to my blog -- the simple process of keeping and publishing a journal related to tech comm that others can read. There's something intrinsically valuable about keeping a journal, and when you share those entries with others online, a kind of magical connection takes place. People read it, add comments, make connections, establish community, learn to trust you, sometimes hire you. They see evidence of your critical thinking and awareness. They even feel they know you personally, as a friend.

I never knew that keeping a journal would have such a profound impact on my career, but it does. These past few weeks, I've been busy with projects, and haven't been writing as much as I used to. In that state of dormancy on my site (which is relatively brief by comparison), I sort of forgot about the purpose of a "web log" -- to be a journal where I record, process, and think about my experiences. Sometimes I get carried away with what a blog post should be. But it's nothing more than a journal entry. 

It is this core journaling function of blogging that sustains my interest and propels me to keep writing, to say "I'd rather be writing," actually, when most others no longer have the desire to write.
