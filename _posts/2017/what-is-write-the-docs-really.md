description: "Write the Docs is an informal meetup group whose members have a variety of professional roles. The group values open source principles, has an entirely volunteer, grassroots style of organization, and has more origins with developer documentation. Because Write the Docs is free and open, it is becoming an increasingly attractive alternative to professional associations like the STC that require yearly dues and have a closed system."

{:toc}

- the stc grew in an pre-internet era. it formed many practices before internet tools were available.
- WTD leverages internet tools. meetup.com for sites, youtube for recordings, slack for communication.
- the stc doesn't really have an overarching function. it's not lobbying washington anymore for anything, so why is it over in DC? revenue last year was $2 million.

## Background

I participate in both [Write the Docs](http://www.writethedocs.org/)(WTD) and [Society for Technical Communication](http://stc.org) (STC) groups. Some people have never heard of Write the Docs, and when they learn of it, they wonder how it differs from the STC or other writing groups. In this post, I'll outline the major differences between the two groups. My intent is not to slam either group, but to clearly and frankly explain how they differ from each other.

## What does "write the docs" mean?

"Write the Docs" may seem like an encouragement to remember to write documentation that accompanies the code you developed. But actually, the original intent is merely a spinoff from "RTFM," which every technical writer knows to mean read the f&*!^!$#@ manual.

## The Write the Docs community

From this "write the docs" mantra grew a small community of people involved in documentation efforts. From developers to support engineers, product managers, QA, technical writers, and all other team members involved in creating and delivering documentation, WTD is a community for sharing best practices, tips, and techniques.

With this background, you can see why Write the Docs tends to have more varied roles among its ranks. It's not a group dedicated soley to official technical writers but rather to everyone involved in creating documentation. (Sometimes you will hear the word "documentarians" as a umbrella way to describe the WTD members.) The [WTD 2016 conference](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2016/) site describes the WTD community as follows:

> Write the Docs brings everyone who writes the docs together in the same room: Writers, Developers, Support Folks. We all have things to learn from each other, and there’s no better way than sitting together and talking.

## Open source foundation

Some other characteristics distinguish WTD from other groups as well, specifically an emphasis on open source projects, community, and grassroots organization.

The day prior to the WTD conference sessions, the members participate in [Writing Day](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2016/writing-day/). As explained on the WTD conference site,  

>The idea [of Writing Day] is simple: to get a bunch of interesting people in a room together and have them work towards shared goals.

> To make the most out of the Writing Day, we recommend that you either come with a project, or be ready and willing to contribute to someone else’s project.

The founding members have a strong belief in the open source movement, and you see this in the way Eric makes available the [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) tooling. If you work on open source projects, you can author and publish using Read the Docs for free.

What is Read the Docs software? The [Welcome page](http://docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) on the Read the Docs site explains:

>Read the Docs hosts documentation for the open source community. We support Sphinx docs written with reStructuredText and CommonMark. We pull your code from your Subversion, Bazaar, Git, and Mercurial repositories. Then we build documentation and host it for you. Think of it as Continuous Documentation. The code is open source, and available on github..

Many of the tools used by WTD members share the same tooling characteristics &mdash; version control workflows with tags and branches (similar to developer workflows), text-file formats, triggers to build your projects when you commit code, and so on. It's the tool world of developer doc.

For an example of what I'm talking about, see this lightning talk from John Mulhausen at a recent WTD meetup:

## Informal community versus professional organization

The Write the Docs group is a community of like-minded people who meet together regularly to share information in an effort to help each other write better documentation. For example, a WTD group in London recently held a [mini-conference on API documentation](http://pronovix.com/documenting-apis-write-docs-mini-conference-london-2016). You can watch every single video and recording on the site, completely free. Additionally, the [WTD conference sessions](http://www.writethedocs.org/videos/) are also recorded and distributed on their site for free.

The WTD meetups are free to attend (many times companies in the area contribute meeting space and food for free), and the yearly conferences are inexpensive as well, with prices ranging from $75 to $350 for the three-day conference.

Of course, the STC fosters community as well, and the reason people go to STC meetings is to interact with other professional technical writers in the area. But the STC is a *professional* organization with a full staff of workers and officers, complete with bylaws and official policies.

Although the STC is a non-profit organization, the STC charges fees for the learning and networking opportunities. This income allows the STC to operate. For example, you have to become a member to get access to the Society's magazine ([Intercom](http://intercom.stc.org/)) and journal ([Technical Communication Journal](http://www.stc.org/technical-communication)).

Membership dues cost between $67 and $395, depending on your role and the benefits you want included. For members, webinars cost $59 to attend. Many STC chapters charge a fee to attend the meetings as well (usually $10-15, which sometimes includes food, though some chapters don't charge). The yearly conference ([STC Summit](http://summit.stc.org/)) costs around $1095 and is a full-scale professional conference, with a large exhibitor hall that attracts around 100 vendors and draws about 700 professional technical communicators.

The STC also promotes the technical writing profession on behalf of its members. For example, the STC lobbied the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](http://www.bls.gov/ooh/media-and-communication/technical-writers.htm) to influence how the profession is defined and classified:

> One of the Society's primary missions has been to prove technical communication's relevance and importance in the world. In 2009, the Society successfully lobbied the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics to recognize Technical Writer as a profession. In 2010, the Society began a year-long project to transform the organization and to prepare for the next fifty years of growth for the profession. (See [About STC](http://www.stc.org/about-stc).)

One of the most useful resources that STC produces is the [2014-2015 Salary Database](http://www.stc.org/salary-database). If you've ever negotiated a job offer, this database is incredibly helpful in establishing a fair salary for your skills and zip code.

## Free communities versus paid associations

As I mentioned, the STC needs income to operate these programs and provide these resources. Hence the paywalls and fees. The problem is that not all members perceive the value for these programs and efforts, so members often wonder if the membership itself is worth it. The WTD group, being free, doesn't have this same value proposition for members to question.

Often I wish the STC were more open with information. If the goal of the Society is to promote learning and information sharing, why not remove the paywall in front of the publications and webinars? Why not lower the cost of the yearly conference and promote more learning resources for free?

No doubt with the "free" model, you would lose the ability to pay a salaried staff to run your organization. Efforts to lobby government organizations, run academic journals and professional publications, provide a continual stream of webinars, allow non-profit tax status for chapters, and generate salary database research would probably fall by the wayside. You would instead rely more heavily on volunteers (even moreso than those who already dedicate their time freely). Without this structure in place, the organization itself could easily wither as volunteers decide to come or go.

The WTD meetup groups can learn from the STC. The WTD group developed somewhat unaware of the existence of the STC, and I don't think the group leverages the resources, research, or other foundations that the STC has laid. There's a good reason &mdash; the STC puts it all behind a paywall.

## Conclusion

Overall, both groups are good, but my guess is that the free model of WTD will win out in the end. Associations are somewhat of a dying model, and without any "continuing education" requirements in the profession (or a need for certification against an established body of knowledge), there's not a huge need for the STC.

When it comes time to renew your STC membership (and your employer doesn't automatically cover it), how willing will people be to contribute $200 toward organizational dues when there's an alternative model for connecting with a community and growing your skills?

Already the [WTD group in SF](http://www.meetup.com/Write-the-Docs/) has 495 members. Average meetings draw about 50 people. Overall, I think a lot of people have been dissatisfied with the STC for a long time, but there hasn't been an alternative until WTD. (As an example of dissatisfied groups, look at the [North Bay Communicators group](http://www.northbaycommunicators.org/), which formed after their STC chapter was closed.)

Now you can [start your own WTD meetup](http://www.writethedocs.org/meetups/starting/) pretty much on your own in a grassroots way, and you can leverage the branding, momentum, and energy of the larger WTD movement. To get started, you basically create a new group on [meetup group](http://meetup.com) (which works great for establishing communities), start planning meetings, inviting people in your community, and watch the group membership grow.

The only problem is that, given our limited time to participate in groups and chapters, it's unlikely that technical writers would participate in both groups for the long term.
