1 why a map? you start out on a journey. you have a point a and point b path you want to travel.
2 is this a perfect metaphor? kind of, yes. i think it might be helpful to think of things this way.
3 diff. between a journey and a map? well, a map is simply a cartography of the land, and as a user you decide on the trail that you'll take to get there. so this idea takes it one step further and lays out the various trails, with descriptions of what each of them contains.
4 think of user like a hiker. does the analogy hold up? more or less. but a map only tries to provide different paths. problem is that one page can only have one toc, hence one map through the content.
5 why hasn't this metaphor been thought before? b/c our role is documentation, not map maker. 
6 what if you were to approach doc like a cartographer or trail guide? well you have more clear purposes about starts and ends, and this purpose is probably more helpful.
7 what if the user doesn't exactly know which trail he or she needs to take? you usually do know where you want to go.
8 the problem with the table of contents is that it provides one map through the forest, could be many other trails to take. not sure how you overcome this, to be honest. could be that you a variety of tables of contents. but this points out a damned if you do, damned if you don't paradox.
9 what are the implications of a map? what are the components? a legend, topographical lines indicate difficulty, etc. different trails have different ratings. yes, more guidance through the terrain.
10. why do people go on hikes? adventure? see new things? get to the top/end? yes, there's a clear end in sight, but one is open to new advneture along the way.

best idea: where it breaks down

I've been intriguedly lately by the idea of a user journey map. A map charts a user's actions through a system, showing key indicators for each milestone. In a way, technical writers are map makers. Documentation should contain various maps outlining ways through the content. 

We create the map, and we also draw trails on the map that indicate ways for users to go from point A to point B. A single map may have many different trails that users can take, depending on where they want to go. Our job is to facilitate their journey.

This metaphor breaks down a bit when you consider the problem of context. If I provide a table of contents for a topic, I lock that topic into one user journey. If I don't have any table of contents, there isn't any context to the topic at all. 

Consider the example of a topic like "Setting up your development environment." This topic is probably referenced on many different tables of contents. So if you include it in the table of contents, you either end up taking users out of their current journey context and into another, or you have a table of contents that is so massive that it doesn't speak to any one journey.
