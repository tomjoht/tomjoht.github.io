what is the problem you are writing about?
- massive products with multiple owners. never had a product like this before. at the same time, never have i been so engaged with a product like this one before. it is truly an interesting product.

why is your situation so different?
- no tech writing model has taught me how to work in this mode.
- i need to rethink my boundaries, practices, etc.

isn't it just a microcosm that is a larger repeating pattern?
- potentially, but maybe not.
- am scrapping scrum/agile. kanban is probably more appropriate, but it's such a different role.

how can you actually tackle this?
- identify all the product owners.
- there are probably 20 different teams working on the product.
- you would then somehow organize your various product teams, but you wouldn't try to meet inside these teams.
- you have a list of reports. you check in with them on a regular basis. you watch their product update pages and track how things are going.
- you don't write their doc for them. you expect them to write it. but at some point they will give it to you, and then you will edit it, try it out, refine the content, and incorporate it into the real documentation.

can you draw your solar system around the product? where is your planet? what does that solar system look like?
- yes, this is what you need to do. what are all the teams? there may be other teams that aren't relevant to you, too. you might just omit these groups. but how can you really tell?

did scrum fail for you?
- yes, because i don't have a team. this approach falls apart when you don't have a team or anything. when you can't push back on deadlines or needs.

what would a successful model look like?
- successful model ... you have a system, a method. you're on top of all deadlines. you have a firm grasp on how to approach things, how to get things done. you aren't taken by surprise at the last minute. you anticipate, you build bridges, you figure out a superior way of interacting

how do you deepen corporate learning?
- you will maybe need to interview different people
- search by product owner roles
- treat corporate learning just like anything else
- actually dedicate whole days to this. in a week you'll crank out a real system that actually works.

can you yourself fall through the cracks?
- yes, but right now you're operating out of a mode of frustration because you're being blind-sided. you want to get to the point where you're not blindsided anymore.
- this is diff. between startup and large corp.

what would you research for this topic?
- not even sure, actually.
- internal corporate learning?


-----------------
cs 2 - your approach

strategy:
- stop attending dumb meetings where you just sit there.
- identify all the product owners you can. product owners for features.
- identify wiki pages for each product
- watch the wiki pages.
- track releases for all the features
- make it clear to each product owner how they can publish doc. have a simple outline of the process. introduce yourself to the product manager and such.
- document the process of documentation, esp. in the context of Fire TV.
- maybe create a bubble map, or a mindflow map?
- before you can document your product, first document the people who own the product. document the product's features.
