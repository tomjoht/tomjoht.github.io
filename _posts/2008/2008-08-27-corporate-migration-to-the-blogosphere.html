<p>A few months ago, I started to write a post about the cultural shift blogging would create in the near and long-term future. I didn't get very far and quickly became mired in speculation. But when I learned today that RJ Jacquez now has a blog, I started to remember some of my predictions. Basically, it goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Amateur bloggers start to saturate Google with content that controls the reputation of company products.</li>
<li>Companies, fearing a complete loss of voice, start joining the blogosphere in masses.</li>
<li>With so many people writing and publishing daily, information grows to a ridiculous degree and becomes difficult to manage.</li>
<li>Search becomes the only way to find anything.</li>
<li>Writers, especially those gifted at SEO and content creation, and who have a lot of Google karma/page rank, become major corporate players, with more prestige than ever before.</li>
</ol>
<p>And right about there I didn't know what came next. I think at some point there's a major shift and people move away from the web altogether, embracing a new form. But I couldn't figure out the details.</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/rjacquez/" target="_blank">RJ Jacquez from Adobe</a>, <a href="http://madcapsoftware2.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Mike Hamilton from Madcap Software</a>, and <a href="http://www.quadralay.com/weblog/aporter/" target="_blank">Alan Porter from WebWorks</a> all have blogs. I suspect <a href="http://authorit.com/" target="_blank">AuthorIt</a> will eventually launch a blog, and the dozens of other software vendors. They're realizing that it's marketing suicide to be offline and silent.</p>
<p>Although these bloggers are all intelligent, clear writers, with solid reputations to give them an authoritative presence, the question is whether they will have the creative muse to write day after day in a way that engages readers. We'll find out.</p>
