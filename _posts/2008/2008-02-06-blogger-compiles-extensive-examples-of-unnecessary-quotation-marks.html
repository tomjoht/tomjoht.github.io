<p>Someone sent this link to me today: a <a href="http://quotation-marks.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">blog of unnecessary quotation marks</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://quotation-marks.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" title="Blog of Unnecessary Quotations"><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/unnecessaryquotations1.png" alt="Blog of Unnecessary Quotations" height="127" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Keep your eye out for any more sightings and send pictures to the author. Of all grammar errors, unnecessary quotation marks are one of the funnest and most playful, as they can change or obscure meanings in hilarious ways.</p>
