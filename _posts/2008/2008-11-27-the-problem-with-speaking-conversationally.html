<p>At the last voice workshop I attended, the instructor (Scott) gave us scripts to read and then critiqued our performance. I tried to imagine myself talking to a friend rather than reading the script, but it didn't come across with much effect. Scott said I was being too reserved, too monotone.</p>
<p>I realized that my conversation technique with voice overs, which I <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2008/11/14/finding-a-conversational-voice-in-video-tutorials/">wrote about with such praise last time</a>, was flawed. When I converse naturally with others, I speak in a boringly flat tone. My colleague has the same problem, only he says he sounds like Eoyre, the donkey on Winnie the Pooh:</p>
<blockquote><p>I tend to speak in a quiet monotone, so doing voice over takes some extra effort. I have to shut myself in a room so that as I read the script, I can speak up loud enough to get varied tones going. That went all right, but it still didn't sound natural. ("<a href="http://www.gryphonmountain.net/archives/techcomm/a-couple-of-things-i-learned-about-captivate-demos-last-week">A Couple of Things I Learned About Captivate Demos Last Week</a>")</p></blockquote>
<p>Scott encouraged me to put more energy to it, to inflect more, and add more emotion and feeling. A background in acting would have been helpful.</p>
<p>This week while watching TV I've been listening closely to the voices (separating them from the visuals on the screen). I can see what Scott is talking about. Actors aren't soft-spoken, reserved people. Actors inflect all over the voice spectrum. They have a lot of energy and drama in their voices.</p>
<p>Here's a graph that reflects that difference in voice inflections.</p>

<p><a href="http://whataboutmomblog.com" target="_blank">Jane</a> says I can still keep the conversation metaphor, but I have to pretend that I'm talking to the president of the United States.</p>
<p>Ben says that gesturing with his hands helps him inflect more:</p>
<blockquote><p>I started gesturing a little with my hands while recording. Interestingly, it made a large difference. My tone sounded much more relaxed and conversational. Tonal changes happened in better places. I also read the script with fewer mistakes. So there's a trick for my bag.</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm supposed to practice voice overs, and right now my practice is limited to reading children's books in creative ways to my kids. But if you and I run into each other at a conference sometime, and I'm moving my hands in strange ways, over-inflecting my voice talking about mundane things, bear with me, I'm practicing.</p>
