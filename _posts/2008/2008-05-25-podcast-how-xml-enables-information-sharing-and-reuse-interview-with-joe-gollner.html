<p>XML, a way of tagging and structuring your content, can help solve a number of problems, including storing, mining, reusing, and sharing content. XML helps enable the interoperability of information between systems, allowing you to export and import your content from one application to another.</p>
<p>XML is behind much of the collaboration and information sharing Web 2.0 technologies, such as RSS (really simple syndication) and blogs. By storing content in XML, technical writers can ensure greater flexibility among technologies for authoring and publishing their content.</p>
<p>Joe Gollner's company, Stilo International, is based in the United Kingdom and has development teams in Ottawa, Canada. Their main focus is content processing, with the goal of enabling high performance, high proficiency automation.</p>
