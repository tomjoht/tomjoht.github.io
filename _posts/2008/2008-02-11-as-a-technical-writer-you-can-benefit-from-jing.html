<p><a href="http://jingproject.com/"><img src="{{site.media}}/jingproject1.png" alt="Jing" width="175" height="138" align="right" />Jing</a>, a new project by TechSmith, is a tool that allows you to quickly capture video or an image from your computer and share it with others, such as project team members or customers.</p>
<p>After you capture images or video with Jing, you click a Share button to quickly upload the capture to a web host, file directory (e.g., SharePoint), or Flickr. Within seconds Jing gives you a URL to share with others. Jing is a cool, easy-to-use tool, and it can have a big impact on IT project teams in the areas of technical support, quality assurance, and development.</p>
<p>To demonstrate Jing, here's a quick example. Let's say you're documenting a project and you suddenly have an idea to enhance the usability. But you know how developers hate to read long explanations when they could watch a movie instead, so you Jing it.</p>

<p>Or let's say that you also provide support for the applications you document, and someone sends you an email asking how to do a task. Instead of writing out a long, tedious procedure, just create a quick jing.</p>

<p>Or suppose you're documenting an application when you notice a bug, but it's kind of hard to explain, and someone really just needs to see it. You can't call over the entire team, but you can create a quick Jing and send it to everyone.</p>

<p>It's often easier to create a jing than to compose an email.</p>
