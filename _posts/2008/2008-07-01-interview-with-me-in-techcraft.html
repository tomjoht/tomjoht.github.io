<p>You can read it here: <a href="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/2008/06/techcraft-enewsletter_volume-38_june-2008.pdf" target="_blank">Techcraft e-Newsletter Volume 38 June 2008.</a> It's in the "Spotlight" section near the end.<a href="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/2008/06/techcraft-enewsletter_volume-38_june-2008.pdf"></a></p>
<p>(You can also log into Yahoo and <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/technical_writers_india/files/TechCraft/">read it here</a> by going to the June 2008 folder, but Rahul gave me permission to post the PDF directly.)</p>
<p>Tech Writers of India (TWI) is one of the most popular listservs in India, with exactly 2,753 members as of this post.</p>
<p>What's the interview all about? Me, of course. First we discuss my childhood, then my teenage years, I explain all the places I've lived .... Just kidding. It's an interview about how I fell into technical writing, blogging, and other online mischief, like WriterRiver.com and podcasting.</p>
<p>By the way, I met Rahul at the STC Summit in Philadelphia last month. He's a genuinely nice guy who was excited by the Philadelphia scene.</p>
