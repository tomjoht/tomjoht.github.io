<p>I read on <a href="http://dontcallmetina.wordpress.com/2008/01/29/more-money-tech-comm-salaries-are-up-in-the-us/" target="_blank">Holly Harkness's blog</a> that the 2008 WritersUA Salary Survey has just been published. Holly writes,</p>
<blockquote><p>The good news is that salaries in the United States now average $76,044, up over $2000 from last year. The bad news is the gender gap in compensation is alive and well. Men average $4000 more per year than women. WritersUA reports that <strong>the gap</strong> <strong>is growing, not shrinking</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>For survey details, see the <a href="http://www.writersua.com/surveys/salary08/index.html" target="_blank">WritersUA salary survey home page</a>. Here's their graph of salary by location.</p>
