<p><a href="{{site.media}}/2008/04/wordpress.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1479" style="float: right;" title="WordPress for Beginners Course" src="{{site.media}}/wordpress-300x2671.png" alt="" width="165" height="146" /></a>WordPress, the most widely used open-source blogging software, gives you complete control over the design and display of your content. In addition to writing blog posts, WordPress allows you to create pages, add categories, customize your site design, define how posts appear, and more.</p>
<p>This two-hour course is designed for people unfamiliar with WordPress and interested in starting their own blogs, or for people ready for more control than Blogger or other hosted sites allow. Topics covered will relate to setting up and using self-hosted WordPress blogs using the free software download from <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress.org</a>, not the freely hosted WordPress.com sites.</p>
<p>I'll also be presenting on WordPress at Doc Train West (<a href="http://www.doctrain.com/west/program_detail/from_novice_to_geek/">"From Novice to Geek: Getting Started with WordPress"</a>). But for those who can't travel to Vancouver, this is a great way to get similar information. This web course will also be more hands-on and interactive.</p>

<strong>Time:</strong> 7:30 p.m. CST<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Web<br />
<strong>Cost:</strong> $99<br />

<h2>Blog Hosting</h2>
<p>To set up your self-hosted WordPress blog, you'll eventually need a web host. You don't need a host before the course, but if you want to get a head start, you can do so.</p>
<p>From personal experience, I highly recommend <a href="http://www.bluehost.com/track/idratherbewriting/text1">Bluehost.com</a>. Blue Host has better live support than any other host. Pretty much any time of the day, you can contact support, either by phone or live chat. Additionally, their cPanel has a Simple Scripts installer that makes installing WordPress simple. I have such confidence in Blue Host that I became an affiliate.</p>
