<p>In this podcast, I talk with <a href="http://keypointe.ca/">Theresa Putkey</a>, a writer/usability consultant in Vancouver, about the largest project of her career. She explains how she approached a project that had upwards of 2,500 help topics, many of which consisted of duplicate content. She explains how she transitioned from RoboHelp to Flare, the advantages she found as well as her regrets, and how she configured the search to make it easy for users to find information.</p>
<p>Theresa recently presented a similar topic at Content Convergence and Integration, a conference in Vancouver. Her presentation was titled <a href="http://convergence.confabb.com/conferences/cci2008/sessions/6570/details">"SuperWoman, WonderWoman, UnderDog, and Leprechaun, with Flare: A case study in breaking down silos."</a> You can view the slides <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/tputkey/superheros-and-a-leprechaun-with-flare-a-case-study-in-breaking-down-silos">from her presentation on SlideShare</a>.</p>
