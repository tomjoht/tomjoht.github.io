<p>Attention podcasters and podcaster wannabes, we're having a podcast meetup at <a href="http://doctrain.com/west">Doc Train West</a>. If you're heading to this conference in Vancouver, stay tuned to more details about this meetup. It'll probably be during one of the evenings of the conference (which takes place May 6-9).</p>
<p>The podcaster meetup will involve an informal exchange, possibly at a restaurant or lounge somewhere, where podcasters introduce themselves to each other, share their recording methods, ask questions, talk about podcasting gear and setups, and in general just enjoy each other's company. The meetup will be a great way to get to know other podcasting peers.</p>

<p>I've been to Vancouver once, but I don't know where the best place would be to meet up. So if you have a good suggestion, let me know.</p>
<p>Also, so far on the list of meetup participants, I have Scott Nesbitt, Aaron Davis, Scott Abel, Rahel Bailie, and Tony Chung.</p>
<p>If you also want to participate, send me your name and contact info (cell, email, or twitter) so that I can send you the details at the conference.</p>
<p>Also, be sure to catch one of the two sessions I'll be presenting in: <a href="http://www.doctrain.com/west/program_detail/meet_the_bloggers/">Meet the Bloggers</a> (includes a blogger panel of 6 fabulous bloggers, moderated by <a href="http://justwriteclick.com/">Anne Gentle</a>), and a session on <a href="http://www.doctrain.com/west/program_detail/from_novice_to_geek/">WordPress</a>.</p>
