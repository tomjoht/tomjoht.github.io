<p><a href="http://www.podcastfaq.com/" target="_blank">PodcastFAQ.com</a> is a new site developed by Todd Cochrane of the <a href="http://www.geeknewscentral.com/" target="_blank">Geek News Central</a> podcast and several other prominent podcasters from <a href="http://www.rawvoice.com/" target="_blank">RawVoice</a>. PodcastFAQ is intended as a much-needed information resource for podcasters.</p>

<p>I was exploring the site yesterday and discovered several things I was unaware of:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://iodapromonet.com/login.php" target="_blank">Ioda Promonet</a> -- a resource for podsafe music (music you can play on your podcast without violating copyright or paying royalties)</li>
<li><a href="http://podcasting.meetup.com/" target="_blank">Podcasting meetups</a> -- I'd heard of meetup.com before, but I didn't realize there were so many podcasters interested in meeting up in my area</li>
<li><a href="http://www.podcastfaq.com/finding-podcasts/communities/" target="_blank">A list of podcast communities</a>, including <a href="http://www.blubrry.com/">Blubrry</a>, <a href="http://www.podcasternews.com/">Podcaster News</a>, <a href="http://www.podshow.com/">Podshow</a>, <a href="http://www.podtech.net/">Podtech</a>, and <a href="http://www.techpodcasts.com/">Tech Podcast Network</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.podcastfaq.com/" target="_blank">PodcastFAQ.com</a> also has a <a href="http://forum.podcastfaq.com/" target="_blank">forum</a>, which I hope will grow in participation. On the topic of podcast forums, the <a href="http://groups.google.rw/group/podcasters-list" target="_blank">Podcasters List Google Group</a> also has an active community of users.</p>
<p>I'm glad to see the creation of this site, PodcastFAQ, since podcasting involves a lot of technical information about audio engineering and creation that can be overwhelming at times. Equipment is expensive, and the methods for producing, editing, and publishing podcasts vary widely.</p>
