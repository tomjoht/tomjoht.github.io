<p><strong>WordPress Training Course</strong><br />
<strong>Date:</strong> Saturday, July 19<br />
<strong>Time: </strong>9 am to noon MST<br />
<strong>Cost:</strong> $99</p>
<p>If you're interested in WordPress training, I'm holding a course this Saturday from 9 a.m. to noon MST over the web. Click the <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/wordpress">WordPress Training</a> button on my navigation bar for details about what's covered and the cost.</p>
<p>Speaking of WordPress, here's a great post from Mashable about <a href="http://mashable.com/2008/07/07/wordpress-compatible-plugins/" target="_blank">20 must-have compatible plugins for WordPress 2.5</a>.</p>
<p>I especially recommend the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/nextgen-gallery/" target="_blank">NextGen Gallery</a> plugin. If you have a lot of photos to post, and you want to group the photos into various galleries, and the galleries into albums, and you want to manage the title and caption text in an easy way, this plugin is amazing. It adds a ton of image functionality to your WordPress installation. For an example of what it can do, view the <a href="http://naplesgreenbuilders.com/gallery" target="_blank">Gallery</a> and <a href="http://naplesgreenbuilders.com/featured-project" target="_blank">Featured Project</a> page of this site. You can also integrate photo effects like the <a href="http://www.airtightinteractive.com/simpleviewer/" target="_blank">SimpleViewer</a> from airtightinteractive.com. This is just one example of how WordPress can go far and beyond Blogger and other platforms.</p>
<p>Of course, you may be content with Blogger, Typepad, LiveJournal, etc., and if so, that's fine. But if you're frustrated with your site's limitations and lack of features, the inability to customize it, or you just want to try something new, it's time to experiment with a <a href="http://wordpress.org">self-hosted WordPress blog</a>. This three-hour course can help get you up and running.</p>
