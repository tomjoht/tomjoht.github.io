<p>IT project teams often need to increase collaboration and communication, but they're hampered by the cubicle walls and other physical silos they set up in the workplace. These physical obstacles force teams to have frequent meetings -- which can be long and inefficient -- just to keep each other updated.</p>
<p>In this podcast, Emma Hamer talks about both physical and virtual workspaces that project teams need to increase their performance. She also outlines the rationale for teams to gather better feedback from users, project members, and others who aren't domain experts.</p>
