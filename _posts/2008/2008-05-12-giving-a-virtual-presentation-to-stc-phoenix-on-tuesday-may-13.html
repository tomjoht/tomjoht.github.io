<p>I'm giving a virtual presentation to the STC-Phoenix chapter tomorrow at 6:15 pm Arizona Time (which right now is the same as PST). The topic of my virtual presentation is "Combining Social Media with Help Authoring." See <a href="http://www.stc-phoenix.com/wp/archives/48">more details here</a>. It costs $10 and should last about an hour. Even though it's coordinated by <a href="http://www.stc-phoenix.com/">STC Phoenix</a>, anyone interested can sign up.</p>
