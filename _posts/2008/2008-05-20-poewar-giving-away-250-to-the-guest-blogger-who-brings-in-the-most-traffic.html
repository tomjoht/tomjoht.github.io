<p><a href="http://www.poewar.com/id-rather-be-writing-versus-men-with-pens/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1531" title="PoeWar Guest Blogging Contest" src="{{site.media}}/poewar1.png" alt="" width="286" height="111" /></a>John Hewitt at Poewar is <a href="http://www.poewar.com/looking-for-guest-bloggers-250-prize/">giving away $250</a> to the guest post that brings in the most traffic to his site. He plans to vacation in June and wants the guest posts to keep his site going while he's away.</p>
<p>I'll admit, the money is alluring. I've already written my guest post and am planning to submit it tomorrow. The due date is May 28, 2008.</p>
<p>John says the posts should be between 400 to 800 words and can be about any of the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Fiction Writing</li>
<li>Essay Writing</li>
<li>Poetry Writing</li>
<li>Technical Writing</li>
<li>Editing</li>
<li>Blogging</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
<li>Freelancing</li>
</ul>
<p>By the way, a couple of weeks ago, John wrote a really funny basketball metaphor <a href="http://www.poewar.com/id-rather-be-writing-versus-men-with-pens/">play-by-play analysis</a> of my site compared with another. I gleaned some good pointers from his constructive criticism: (1) I need to be more responsive to comments and pingbacks on my posts. And (2) I need to reduce the clutter from my sidebars. I've been trying to implement both suggestions to make my blog better. Thanks John.</p>
