<p>At the end of many topics in Flare's help, a <em>What's Next? </em>section appears. For example, in a topic on <em><a href="http://madcapsoftware.com/support/webhelp/flare/Content/Steps/S2_Add_Stuff/TOCs/Creating_a_Table_of_Contents.htm">Creating a Table of Contents</a></em>, the <em>What's Next? </em>feature guesses what you'll want to do next -- enable the table of contents in your target. See the following image.</p>

<p>Having used Flare's help for a while, I really like this <em>What's Next?</em> feature. For me, it works better than the <em>See Also</em> references, which are more common. (One time I asked a user why he never clicked the <em>See Also</em> link as he was looking for information. He said, "I've clicked it before in other help systems and it was never helpful, so I just assumed I'd have the same experience.")</p>
<p>Not every topic in Flare's help has a <em>What's Next?</em> section at the bottom, but I wish every topic did. I'm surprised I don't see this feature in more help systems. It seems like such a logical way to end a topic.</p>
<p>In some ways, it helps provide transitional glue from one topic to the next. People can land anywhere in your help system, but through the <em>What's Next? </em>section, you can recommend where they should go next.</p>
<p>If you add a <em>What's Next? </em>section at the bottom of each topic, it might also provide a better structure for your table of contents layout. In some cases, the <em>What's Next?</em> topic may help you see how the table of contents should be arranged.</p>
