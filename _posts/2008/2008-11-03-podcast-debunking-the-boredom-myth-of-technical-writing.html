<p>Several weeks ago I wrote about <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2008/10/13/becoming-a-writer-reflections-on-a-trip-to-idaho/" target="_self">my trip to Brigham Young University-Idaho</a> and the presentation I gave there titled "Debunking the Boredom Myth of Technical Writing." This podcast is a recording of my presentation.</p>
<p>My presentation was part of the professional writing conference that <a href="http://byui.edu/" target="_blank">BYU-Idaho</a> puts on annually for their writing and literature students. In the presentation, I talk about a prevalent myth that many students have -- that technical writing is a boring career. To combat the myth, I explore the variety of content technical writers produce, including video, diagrams and illustrations, quick reference material, wikis, online help, information architecture, blogs, wikis, podcasts, and usability.</p>
