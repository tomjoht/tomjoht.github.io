<p>If you have a lot of photos that you want to organize online, like <a href="http://whoolery.com/mat/pictures_archive.htm" target="_blank">this site</a>, don't manually embed them into individual html pages. You'll either go insane or your family will leave you.</p>
<p>Instead, use the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/nextgen-gallery/" target="_blank">NextGen Gallery plugin</a> (and a <a href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress self-hosted blog</a>). The NextGen Gallery plugin allows you to upload zip files of photos in one batch and arrange them in galleries and albums so quickly it'll feel like cheating. (Here's <a href="http://www.naplesgreenbuilders.com/gallery/" target="_blank">an example</a> of NextGen Gallery implementation.)</p>
