<p align="left"><img src="{{site.media}}/marriott1.jpg" alt="marriott.jpg" align="right" />In May I'll be participating on a <a href="http://doctrain.com/west/" target="_blank">Documentation and Training West</a> panel in a session called <a href="http://www.doctrain.com/west/program_detail/meet_the_bloggers/">Meet the Bloggers</a>. As a presenter, <a href="http://thecontentwrangler.com">Scott Abel</a> has given me a free guest ticket to the conference to give to one of my friends. I've decided to give the ticket away to one of my readers by way of a little contest. (In case you're wondering, Scott gave me permission to do this.)</p>
<p>To enter the contest, just leave a reply to the contest question below either in the comments field or in a post on your site that links back to this post (make sure the trackback appears in the comments area -- if it doesn't, add a comment that has a link to your post).</p>
<p>Here is the contest question:</p>
<blockquote><p>What's the most innovative thing you've done, or the most innovative thing you want to do, in the field of technical communication?</p></blockquote>
<p>Given that the theme of the conference is Web 2.0 and Its Impact on Technical Communication, innovative practices should be a nice fit (but your innovation doesn't have to be Web 2.0-related). The deadline for the contest is Monday, Feb 18.</p>
<p>Please note that the ticket provides entrance to the conference only, and does not pay for hotel, travel, or meals. The conference takes place May 6 through 9 in Vancouver, B.C.  (And if you win the ticket, you don't have to "hang out" with me or anything.)</p>
<p>I'll pick the winner using an objective <a href="http://www.mdani.demon.co.uk/para/random.htm" target="_blank">Random Number Generator</a> (rather than trying to determine the best answer).</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Even if you're not interested in attending said conference, please let me know your innovative thoughts anyway. Also, if you aren't subscribed to <a href="http://thecontentwrangler.com" target="_blank">The Content Wrangler</a> (Scott's blog), check it out.</p>
