While I'm reading a page of a book, there's a section at the bottom called "Additional Reading." Based on keyword/topic matches, it pulls similar content from other chapters of other books in the Safari library.</p>
<p>It's not just showing me related books for my topic, but is showing me related chapters from other books. I ended up not just reading one book, but reading similar chapters of about 5 different books tonight. This integration breaks down the silos between books and seems to create one seamless library of information. All I can say is, this is totally awesome.</p>
