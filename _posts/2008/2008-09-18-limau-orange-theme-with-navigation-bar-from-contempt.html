<blockquote><p>I had a small question about your blog's template. I really liked the template as soon as I saw it and went ahead and downloaded it. Could you let me know how you added the navigation tabs on the top? I am not much of a programmer but I can work with php and css to an extent. I'd be highly obliged if you could help me set up the same :)</p>
<p>And I hope you that you keep posting GREAT content - I love it!</p>
<p>All the best,<br />

<p>Dear Sapphire,</p>
<p>Thanks for the compliments on my theme hack. The original theme is the <a href="http://www.blogohblog.com/wordpress-theme-limau-orange/" target="_blank">Limau-Orange theme</a> by Blog oh Blog. I wanted a top navigation bar so I used one from the <a href="http://www.raven.za.net/wp-themes/contempt-wordpress-theme" target="_blank">Contempt theme</a>. It took a few hours of wrangling to make it fit. You can download my hybrid here: <a href="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/2008/09/limau-orange-toolbar.zip">Limau-Orange Theme with Contempt's Toolbar.</a> Make sure you change the logo.</p>
<p>One a side note, I've been fairly happy with this theme. Minimalistic themes don't become eyesores as fast as others.</p>
