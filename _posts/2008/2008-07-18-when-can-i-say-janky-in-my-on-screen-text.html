<p>In the on-screen text in WordPress, on the Write &gt; Page screen, I ran across the following help text.</p>
<p><a href="{{site.media}}/2008/07/janky_wordpress.png"><img src="{{site.media}}/janky_wordpress2.png" alt="When you can use the word Janky in your documentation?" title="When you can use the word Janky in your documentation?" width="484" height="206" class="size-full wp-image-1707" /></a></p>
<p>Just yesterday <a href="http://www.gryphonmountain.net/archives/techcomm/writing-documentation-like-a-real-live-person">my colleague Ben was asking</a> how I felt about the use of contractions in help. Contractions? We've moved far beyond contractions. We're now using terms like <em>janky</em>.</p>
<p>How I would love to publicly insult the applications I document! <em>E.g., Hey, we know this feature is kludgey, but we couldn't find an easy fix. Hang on -- the next release will get better.</em></p>
