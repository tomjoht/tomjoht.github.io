The download is several hundred megs, and eventually Adobe pushes out updates that break it right when you need to deliver PDFs for your latest release.</p>
<p>In contrast, you can download the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=4d951911-3e7e-4ae6-b059-a2e79ed87041&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">Save as PDF or XPSÂ add-in for Microsoft Word 2007</a> for free. It's less than 1 megabyte to download, and it quickly and flawlessly converts Word docs to PDF, even with hyperlinks. If you have non-Word documents to convert, <a href="http://www.primopdf.com/" target="_blank">Primo PDF</a> (another free PDF alternative) will do it absolutely free.<br />

<p>It's a wonder why people still buy Adobe Acrobat. Granted, you can combine and arrange different PDF files, and annotate PDF documents, but is that really worth hundreds of dollars?</p>
