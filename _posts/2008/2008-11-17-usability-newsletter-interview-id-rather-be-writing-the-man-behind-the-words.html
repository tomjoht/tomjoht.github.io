<p>I was recently interviewed by David Dick for the Usability SIG newsletter. The title of the interview is "I'd Rather Be Writing – The Man Behind the Words." <a href="http://www.stcsig.org/usability/newsletter/0810-InterviewTJ.htm">Check it out</a>.</p>
<p>They also reprinted my post on <a href="http://www.stcsig.org/usability/newsletter/0810-Sharepoint.htm">Customizing Sharepoint</a>, which has gotten more hits than I ever imagined.</p>
