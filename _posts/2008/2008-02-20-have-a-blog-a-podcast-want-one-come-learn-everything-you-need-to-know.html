<p>I'm no longer president of my STC chapter in Florida. But I'm excited to give a presentation to the local <a href="http://www.intermountain-stc.org/">STC-Intermountain chapter</a> on blogging and podcasting next week. Here are the details of my upcoming presentation.</p>
<p><em>Have a Blog? a Podcast? Want one? Come learn everything you need to know</em></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Feb 28, 2008<br />
<strong>Time: </strong>7:00 P.M.<br />
<strong>Location: </strong><a href="http://www.slcc.edu/locations/southcity.asp">SLCC South City Campus</a>, Room W111 E, 1575 S. State St., Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000493.html"><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/blogseachday1.png" alt="Rate of increase of new blogs per day" align="right" height="216" width="290" /></a>With over 120,000 new blogs started every day, and an average of 1.5 million new posts per day, blogging has become mainstream. Almost every writer I meet either has a blog or has contemplated starting one.</p>
<p>Although blogging seems, on the surface, to simply be another form of writing, the online and social contexts of blogging have given rise to a fascinating culture of complex “rules” about what to write, strategies for gaining an audience, and theories on which formats, gimmicks, and content appeal most to readers.</p>
<p>The blog format can be a writer's paradise, full of opportunities to exercise your writing talents and interact with other professionals in your field. Drop the notion that blogs posts involve cat adventures and baby updates. Your blog can be a powerful vehicle for professional growth and job marketability. And the interactivity and immediacy of blog writing will help you find creative fulfillment in a profession where dry procedural writing leaves your literary talent unused 90% of the day. </p>
