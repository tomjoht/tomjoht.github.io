I'm using Feedburner's iTunes podcasting elements options to meet all the iTunes specifications. I hope this works better than Podpress did.</p>

<p>(I ended up burning a new Feedburner feed and resubmitting it, so if you still see the old one in there, ignore it.) Note also that I have an iTunes subscribe button in my left sidebar now.</p>
<p>By the way, how many of you out there are iTunes listeners? If you ever feel inclined to rate my show in iTunes, I'll thank you with a link to your site or blog, if you want.</p>
