<p>In this podcast, Noz Urbina talks about how Web 2.0 is changing the role of the technical communicator into one who drives product R&amp;D and interaction design. My discussion with Noz was a light-bulb moment for me at the Doc Train West conference. </p>
<p>Podcast topics include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>How the role of the technical communicator has evolved into a diversity of roles</li>
<li>How awareness of user needs and requirements allows technical communicators to get involved in product R&amp;D and user interaction design</li>
<li>How implementing a backwards flow of data from hundreds of internal and external users changes the role of a technical writer to one who aggregates, synthesizes, and ensures quality rather than one who merely writes</li>
<li>How the technical communicator becomes the keyholder on the pipeline of customer data, which in turn allows the technical communicator to direct and define the product</li>
<li>How to encourage a culture of participation through surveys and other user interviews</li>
</ul>
<p>Noz is a business development manager for <a href="http://mekon.com/">Mekon</a>. He's also heavily involved in <a href="http://x-pubs.com/">X-pubs.com</a>, a nonprofit conference and information resource that produces seminars, online events, white papers, and annual conferences.</p>
