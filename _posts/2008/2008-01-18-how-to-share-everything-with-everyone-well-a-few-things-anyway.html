<p>In the pages section of my site (upper-left corner), I've added several new features: a Google Reader <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/blogroll/">blogroll</a>, <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/podroll/">podroll</a>, and a shared <a href="http://www.pandora.com/people/thj7#">Pandora feed</a>. This blogroll is different from the usual blogroll. This blogroll is a javascript that inserts feeds from my Google Reader. Now you can know exactly what I'm reading, and I don't have to maintain a blogroll list separate from my feedreader list.</p>
<p>It seems that we're sharing everything these days -- what we read, listen to, who we are, what we do. In this post I provide a little technical writer how-to on these topics.</p>
<h3>Sharing Your Google Reader Blogroll</h3>
<p>To add a Google Reader blogroll to your site:</p>
<p>1. Go to <a href="http://google.com/reader" target="_blank">google.com/reader</a>, log into your Google account, and click <strong>Settings </strong>in the upper-right corner.</p>
<p><img src="{{site.media}}/1-settings1.png" alt="1-settings.png" /></p>
<p>(By the way, as far as feedreaders go, nothing can compare with <a href="http://google.com/reader" target="_blank">Google Reader</a>.)</p>
<p><br />
2. Go to the <strong>Tags </strong>tab.</p>
<p><img src="{{site.media}}/2-tags1.png" alt="2-tags.png" /></p>
<p>You'll notice that your tags are basically your folders. I have my feeds grouped into different folders/tags.</p>
<p>3. Click the gray <strong>public/private</strong> icon <img src="{{site.media}}/" height="16" width="16" /> to make your tag/folder public. The icon turns orange <img src="{{site.media}}/" height="16" width="16" />.</p>
<p><img src="{{site.media}}/3-tagicon2.png" alt="3-tagicon.png" /></p>
<p>4.  Click the <strong>add a clip to your site</strong> link.</p>
<p><img src="{{site.media}}/4-addacliptosite11.png" alt="4-addacliptosite1.png" /></p>
<p>5. In the window that pops up, copy the javascript code (after selecting the color style you want).</p>
<p>6. Insert the code into a page of your blog. (When inserting code, it's best to switch to the code view of any editor you have.) If you use Blogger, it's even easier to add the code.</p>
<p>Voila, your Google Reader feed is magically integrated into your site.</p>

<h3>Podroll</h3>
<p>My "Podroll" (list of podcast feeds I listen to) is just a group of feeds tagged as podcasts. Still, I'd love to find other podrolls out there.</p>
<h3>Sharing Your Pandora Feed</h3>
<p>First, a little bit about <a href="http://pandora.com" target="_blank">Pandora</a>. I listen to Pandora pretty frequently. The music is free, commercial free, and it has a good selection. You just type an artist or song you like, and it plays similar songs from a database of music with similar tags. For example, type "Leaving Las Vegas" and you'll get a decent station. You can even give songs a thumbs up or down, and it tries to learn what you like.</p>
<p>But beyond simply listening to music online, you can share your <a href="http://www.pandora.com/people/thj7#" target="_blank">bookmarked music feed </a>with others.</p>
<p>Here's how you share your Pandora bookmarked feed:</p>
<p>1. Go to <a href="http://pandora.com" target="_blank">Pandora.com</a> and create an account.</p>
<p>2. When you hear a song you like, move your mouse over the graphic and click the triangle.</p>
<p><img src="{{site.media}}/pandora211.png" alt="pandora21.png" /></p>
<p>3. Select what you want to bookmark -- the artist, song, or something else.</p>
<p><a href="{{site.media}}/2008/01/pandora3.png" title="pandora3.png"><img src="{{site.media}}/pandora31.png" alt="pandora3.png" /></a></p>
<p>The bookmarked song is added to your Pandora page, which has its own feed. The URL for your bookmarked page is what appears in your web browser.</p>
<p>Readers can subscribe to your feed by clicking the standard RSS feed icon, as shown in the image below.</p>
<p><img src="{{site.media}}/pandora41.png" alt="pandora4.png" /></p>
<p>By the way, another great music site similar to Pandora is <a href="http://www.last.fm/dashboard/" target="_blank">Last.fm</a>.</p>
<h3>Sharing Google Reader Items</h3>
<p>While we're on the topic of sharing, let's go back to Google Reader. With Google Reader, you can tag and share posts you like. This leads to the concept of human-based aggregation, which is incredibly efficient for finding good content to read. You don't have to sort through thousands of feeds to find several worthwhile nuggets. Instead, you have a handful of people sifting through their feeds, doing the work for you. (I posted a video of Robert Scoble <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2007/06/04/scoble-video-tracking-rss-feeds/">sifting through 622 feeds</a> a while ago.)</p>
<p>Here's how you share items you like from your Google Reader:</p>
<p>1. Click the <strong>Share </strong>button under a post you like.</p>
<p><img src="{{site.media}}/sharegoogle1.png" alt="sharegoogle.png" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.g2meyer.com/usablehelp/" target="_blank">(Usable Help</a> from Gordon Meyer, by the way, is an excellent blog.)</p>
<p>2. Click the <strong>Your shared items </strong>link in the upper-left to see your shared items page.</p>
<p><img src="{{site.media}}/shared21.png" alt="shared2.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As a bonus, if your Gmail contacts mark posts from their Google Reader as shared, you automatically see their shared feeds under a "Friends' Shared Items" section in your Google Reader. As you can see, <a href="http://heidilhansen.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Heidi Hansen</a> has a shared Google feed. And if you add me as a Gmail contact (tomjoht@gmail.com), you'll see my Shared feeds too.</p>
<p>3. Your shared items are aggregated into a feed of their own, which people can subscribe to.</p>
<p><img src="{{site.media}}/shared51.png" alt="shared5.png" /></p>
<p>Here's my <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/14956448268706131592">Google Shared Items page</a>. My only complaint is that sharing a post doesn't seem to ping the author with a notification that I've marked his or her post.</p>
<p>(By the way, the Google Reader team has a worthwhile blog at <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://googlereader.blogspot.com/</a>.)</p>
<h3>Sharing Your Professional Resume</h3>
<p>By now you're thinking, what else can I share? Yes, there's more. What list would be incomplete without <a href="http://linkedin.com" target="_blank">Linkedin</a>? Every now and then people ask for my Linkedin page, so here it is: <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/myprofile?trk=tab_pro" target="_blank">Tom Johnson on Linkedin</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/myprofile?trk=tab_pro" target="_blank"><img src="{{site.media}}/linkedin1.png" alt="linkedin.png" /></a></p>
<p>If you want, send me an invitation to connect with your network. I only have 21 connections, and I think to be cool you need at least several hundred. :)</p>
<h3>Sharing Your Time with Google Chat</h3>
<p>I'm not huge into IM, but I get a lot of people asking me if I have a gmail address because they want to add me to their list of contacts that they can do Google Chat with. (My gmail address is, by the way, tomjoht@gmail.com if you want to add me as a contact.)</p>
<p>To add a contact to your gmail:</p>
<p>1. Click the <strong>Contacts </strong>link in the left pane.</p>
<p>2. Click the <strong>Add Contact </strong>button <img src="{{site.media}}/addcontact1.png" alt="addcontact.png" /> and add the contact.</p>
<p>Once you have a list of contacts, you can initiate a chat session with any of them by clicking the green circle next to their name. Here's my wife's cousin below -- he's a genius with translation of technical material.</p>
<p><img src="{{site.media}}/samplegmail1.png" alt="samplegmail.png" /></p>
<p>Clicking the green circle opens a popup instant message window in the lower-right corner of your screen. It's a nice way to make exchanges more efficient and stop going back and forth with email.</p>
<p>The color of the circle shows one's availability.</p>
<h3>Sharing Other Things</h3>
<p>You can share almost anything online today. Here are a few more things you can share:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.shelfari.com/" target="_blank">Shelfari </a>allows you to share a virtual bookshelf.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/" target="_blank">Slideshare </a>allows you to share Powerpoints presentations you've given (here's <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/BillAlbing" target="_blank">Bill Albing's Slideshare page</a>).</li>
<li><a href="http://confabb.com" target="_blank">Confabb </a>allows you to share conferences you've attended and your reviews of the sessions (For example, here's <a href="http://www.confabb.com/users/profile/thecontentwrangler" target="_blank">Scott Abel's confabb page</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>I purposely excluded <a href="http://twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter </a>because I've never seen the appeal.</p>
<p>What am I missing from this list (that you actually use)?</p>
<h3>Implications</h3>
<p>As Bill Albing said in <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/2008/01/14/podcast-the-impact-of-social-media-on-technical-communication-interview-with-bill-albing/" target="_blank">the last podcast</a>, we're moving toward a shared network model, where people publish and subscribe. The really appealing sites integrate feeds for a community of users in an invisible, seamless way, making it easy to see what we're all up to. As for privacy, it doesn't seem that much of a concern.</p>
