<p><a href="http://clearplay.com/" target="_blank"><img src="{{site.media}}/clearplay1.png" alt="Clearplay" align="right" />Clearplay</a> is a DVD player that filters out profanity, extreme violence, and sexuality from movies, toning them down from R to PG-13, or from PG-13 to PG (if you want).</p>
<p>Whereas other filtering methods involve physically altering the media, Clearplay works differently. You download filter files  from Clearplay's site, load them onto a flash drive, plug the flash drive into the Clearplay DVD player, select to apply the filter to the movie, and voila, your R movie is suddenly much more family friendly.</p>
<p><br />
The filter doesn't alter the movie's physical media at all. And you don't have to buy special pre-edited movies -- you can rent them from Blockbuster or wherever.</p>
<p>Clearplay may not appeal to many of my readers, but in the event that you're interested, you can get special discounts by mentioning that I referred you. E-mail <a href="mailto:jweed@clearplay.com">jweed@clearplay.com</a>, include my name ("Tom Johnson"), and you'll get a discounted price for players and memberships. Actually, if you just email that address expressing interest, I get some kickbacks.</p>
<p>It's a technically ingenious solution and I'm not sure entirely how it works -- it just does.</p>
