    LLM-based AI tools, such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude, can help you with documentation-related activities.  You can use AI tools to both learn code and write code yourself. You can use AI tools to get language advice, to identify answers when fixing bugs, to analyze large sets of information from threads, comments, and feedback, to compare API responses with schemas, and more. Using AI tools requires you to provide a lot of direction, review, and guidance, so don't expect too much from them. Still, they can perform some of the documentation work in impressive ways, leading to increased productivity.

    Prompt engineering refers to crafting prompts in a way that yields the result you want. Although prompt engineering techniques are fairly intuitive, few people have meticulously applied prompt engineering techniques to scenarios involving tech writers writing documentation.
