## About the AI Book Club

The AI Book Club for technical writers focuses on reading and discussing books about AI, with an occasional emphasis on techcomm because many book club members are technical writers. Although the news in this space seems to change daily, giving the impression that books are too slow to keep up, actually the core issues and themes have much more longevity. Books elevate our thinking and engagement with these more timeworn topics &mdash; beyond the latest model release, news-grabbing headlines, or shocking turn of events.

The reading pace is one book a month, as listed in the table and schedule below. This accelerated pace ensures that engaging in this club will likely pull you away from social media and require you to spend time on the printed page. The meetings take place online through Google Meet, with recordings posted afterwards. There's also a Slack workspace for online chat, and an email group for announcements.

There's no cost to join, and you can attend as few or many meetings as you like. You can read part of all of the books, and participate as much or little as you like. 

## Reading schedule

The following table lists the reading schedule. The descriptions are extracts from the book's summary on Amazon. Links for the notes/discussion and Google Meet will be added as the meeting date approaches.

             <p class="book-summary">"<i>More Than Words</i> argues that generative AI programs like ChatGPT not only can kill the student essay but should, since these assignments don’t challenge students to do the real work of writing. To Warner, writing is thinking—discovering your ideas while trying to capture them on a page—and feeling—grappling with what it fundamentally means to be human. The fact that we ask students to complete so many assignments that a machine could do is a sign that something has gone very wrong with writing instruction. More Than Words calls for us to use AI as an opportunity to reckon with how we work with words—and how all of us should rethink our relationship with writing."</p>

             <p class="book-summary">"<i>Nexus</i> looks through the long lens of human history to consider how the flow of information has shaped us, and our world. Taking us from the Stone Age, through the canonization of the Bible, early modern witch-hunts, Stalinism, Nazism, and the resurgence of populism today, Yuval Noah Harari asks us to consider the complex relationship between information and truth, bureaucracy and mythology, wisdom and power. He explores how different societies and political systems throughout history have wielded information to achieve their goals, for good and ill. And he addresses the urgent choices we face as non-human intelligence threatens our very existence."</p>

             <p class="book-summary">"In <i>Co-Intelligence</i>, Mollick urges us to engage with AI as co-worker, co-teacher, and coach. He assesses its profound impact on business and education, using dozens of real-time examples of AI in action. Co-Intelligence shows what it means to think and work together with smart machines, and why it's imperative that we master that skill. / Mollick challenges us to utilize AI's enormous power without losing our identity, to learn from it without being misled, and to harness its gifts to create a better human future. Wide ranging, hugely thought-provoking, optimistic, and lucid, Co-Intelligence reveals the promise and power of this new era."</p>

            <p class="book-summary">"In <i>Supremacy</i>, Olson, tech writer at Bloomberg, tells the astonishing story of the battle between these two AI firms [ OpenAI and DeepMind], their struggles to use their tech for good, and the hazardous direction they could go as they serve two tech Goliaths whose power is unprecedented in history. The story focuses on the continuing rivalry of two key CEOs at the center of it all, who cultivated a religion around their mission to build god-like super intelligent machines: Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, and Demis Hassabis, the CEO of DeepMind."</p>

             <p class="book-summary">"...Lee argues powerfully that because of the unprecedented developments in AI, dramatic changes will be happening much sooner than many of us expected.... Most experts already say that AI will have a devastating impact on blue-collar jobs. But Lee predicts that Chinese and American AI will have a strong impact on white-collar jobs as well. Is universal basic income the solution? In Lee’s opinion, probably not. But he provides a clear description of which jobs will be affected and how soon, which jobs can be enhanced with AI, and most importantly, how we can provide solutions to some of the most profound changes in the future of human history."

But it’s also affecting us in more insidious ways. It touches everything from our interpersonal relationships, to our kids’ education, work, finances, public services, and even our human rights. / By highlighting the voices of ordinary people in places far removed from the cozy enclave of Silicon Valley, Code Dependent explores the impact of a set of powerful, flawed, and often-exploitative technologies on individuals, communities, and our wider society. Murgia exposes how AI can strip away our collective and individual sense of agency, and shatter our illusion of free will."</p>

The rise of science and Descartes's division of mind from world made materialism our ruling paradigm, in the process asking whether our own consciousness &mdash; i.e., souls—might be illusions. Now the inexorable rise of technology, with artificial intelligences that surpass our comprehension and control, and the spread of digital metaphors for self-understanding, the core questions of existence—identity, knowledge, the very nature and purpose of life itself—urgently require rethinking."</p>

Lee and Chen join forces to imagine our world in 2041 and how it will be shaped by AI.

## Monthly meetings

The meetings are usually the *third Sunday of the month*. Some of the dates might shift due to unpredictable schedules. After we gauge more interest in the club and where everyone is located, we can evaluate the times. In general, either London or Sydney timezones are problematic when coordinating with Seattle (where I'm located).

## Online discussion forum

There's a Slack workspace set up for online discussion here: [aibookclubtechcomm](https://aibookclubtechcomm.slack.com). The Slack workspace is used to chat, share info or other thoughts, etc. However, the main interaction will be with the monthly meetings.

## Email list

In addition to Slack, there's an email list you should sign up for to receive announcements, information, and other details. I'll try to post similar info on Slack, but email can be easier for people who don't have Slack open all the time.

<iframe data-w-type="embedded" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="https://0gj01.mjt.lu/wgt/0gj01/xqnx/form?c=b362b3d3" width="100%" style="height: 0;"></iframe>

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://app.mailjet.com/pas-nc-embedded-v1.js"></script>

## Google Meet for the meetings

For the monthly meetings, we use [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/). Links to the specific meetings will be added to the Schedule above. 

## FAQ

**How did you come up with the book list?**
: I look for books that are both popular and highly rated, so preferably books that have hundreds of reviews and and average at least 4 stars. 

**Isn't this field changing too fast for books?**
: Perhaps. However, many of these authors are wrestling with topics that go beyond the daily news headlines and which speak to long-term transitions in the way we think and work. 

**I'm not sure if I have time to read books.**
: There's a mental health benefit to reading long-form content instead of scrolling through bite-sized information nuggets. Reading books provides deeper engagement and more satisfying experience for the brain. It takes time to read a 300-page book. That reading patience will offset a world saturated in short-form content and fragmented attention spans.

**What are the meetings like?**
: The meetings are interactive and discussion-based, as you might expect from any book club. To prepare for the book club meetings, I provide a notes document that summarizes  the book's themes and also presents some questions for discussion. 

**Can I recommend a book?**
: Sure, send your book recommendations either to the [aibookclubtechcomm](https://aibookclubtechcomm.slack.com) or to me directly via the [contact form here](/contact).

**I'm not a technical writer -- can I still join?**
: Sure, you don't need to be a technical writer. I only added this facet to try to ground what is a broad domain (AI) with something more immediate and practical.
