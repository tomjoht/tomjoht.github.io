## About the AI Book Club

The AI Book Club (with an emphasis on techcomm) focuses on reading and discussing books about AI. Why the "emphasis on techcomm"? While the AI Book Club is open to anyone, many members are working in techcomm professions, so the discussions will likely emphasize techcomm scenarios and applications. 

There's no cost to join, and you can attend as few or many meetings as you like. You can read part of all of the books, and participate as much or little as you like. 

The reading pace is one book a month, as listed in the table and schedule below. The meetings take place online through Google Meet, with recordings posted afterwards. There's also a Slack workspace for online chat, and an email group for announcements.

## Reading schedule

Note that links for the notes/discussion and Google Meet will be added as the meeting date approaches.

## Monthly meetings

The meetings are usually the *third Sunday of the month*. Some of the dates might shift due to unpredictable schedules (who knows their commitments a year in advance). After we gauge more interest in the club and where everyone is located, we can evaluate the times. In general, either London or Sydney timezones are problematic when coordinating with Seattle (where I'm located).

## Online discussion forum

There's a Slack workspace set up for online discussion here: [aibookclubtechcomm](https://aibookclubtechcomm.slack.com). The Slack workspace is used to chat, share info or other thoughts, etc. However, the main interaction will be with the monthly meetings.

## Email list

In addition to Slack, there's an email list you should sign up for to receive announcements, book info, and other details. I'll try to post similar info on Slack, but email can be easier for people who don't have Slack open all the time.

## Google Meet for the meetings

For the monthly meetings, we use [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/). Links to the specific meetings will be added to the Schedule above. 

## FAQ

**How did you come up with the book list?**

I look for books that are both popular and highly rated, so preferably books that have hundreds of reviews and and average at least 4 stars. I don't want to spend time reading poorly written or uninformative books, given our limited reading time. 

**Isn't this field changing too fast for books?**

Perhaps. However, many of these authors are wrestling with topics that go beyond the daily news headlines and which speak to long-term transitions in the way we think and work. 

**I'm not sure if I have time to read books.**

There's a mental health benefit to reading long-form content instead of scrolling through bite-sized information nuggets. Reading books provides deeper engagement and more satisfying experience. It takes time to read a 300-page book. That reading patience provides an offset to a world saturated in short-form content and fragmented attention spans.

**What are the meetings like?**

The meetings are interactive and discussion-based, as you might expect from any book club. To prepare for the book club meetings, I provide a notes document that summarize some of the book's themes and also presents some questions for discussion. 

**Can I recommend a book?**

Sure, send your book recommendations either to the [aibookclubtechcomm](https://aibookclubtechcomm.slack.com) or to me directly via the [contact form here](/contact).
