## Overview

The AI Book Club focuses on reading and discussing books about AI. The AI Book Club is open to anyone, although many members are working in techcom professions. There's no cost to join, and you can attend as few or many meetings as you like. You can read part of all of the books, and participate as much or little as you like. 

The reading pace is one book a month, as listed in the table and schedule below. The meetings take place online through Google Meet, with recordings posted afterwards.

## FAQ

**How did you come up with the book list?**

I look for books that are both popular and highly rated, so preferably books that have hundreds of reviews and and average at least 4 stars. I don't want to spend time reading poorly written or uninformative books, given our limited reading time. 

**Isn't this field changing too fast for books?**

Perhaps. However, many of these authors are wrestling with topics that go beyond the daily news headlines and which speak to long-term transitions in the way we think and work. 

**I'm not sure if I have time to read books.**

There's a mental health benefit to reading long-form content instead of scrolling through bite-sized information nuggets. Reading books provides deeper engagement and more satisfying experience. It takes time to read a 300-page book. That reading patience provides an offset to a world saturated in short-form content and fragmented attention spans.

**What are the meetings like?**

The meetings are interactive and discussion-based, as you might expect from any book club. To prepare for the book club meetings, I provide a notes document that summarize some of the book's themes and also presents some questions for discussion. 

**Can I recommend a book?**

Sure, send your book recommendations to me the [contact form here](/contact).
