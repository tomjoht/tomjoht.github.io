This book club focuses on reading and discussing popular books about AI, with an emphasis on how humans, specifically tech writers, might steer and guide AI systems toward the outcomes they want. 

The reading covers general books on AI, not necessarily books oriented towards tech comm, or engineering-heavy books, or even books specifically focusing on this "human in the loop" theme. As you can see from the reading schedule below, the books are generally popular books on AI targeting a general interest audience. 

However, these books are a good catalyst for thinking about AI, and there might be many themes and takeaways that will likely apply to whatever you're interested in. The human-in-the-loop theme encourages us to look for ways to stay relevant at a time when AI becomes increasingly intelligent and self-directed.

## Reading pace {#readingpace}

The reading pace is one book a month, as listed in the schedule below. This accelerated pace ensures that engaging in this club will likely pull you away from the minutiae of life and require you to spend time on the printed page. The meetings take place online through Google Meet, with recordings posted afterwards. There's also a  workspace for online chat, and an email group for announcements.

Although AI news seems to change daily, giving the impression that books are too slow to keep up, the core issues and themes have much more longevity. Books elevate our thinking and engagement with these topics, allowing us to engage beyond just keeping up with the latest model release or newsy headlines.

There's no cost to join the book club (except buying the books), and you can attend as few or many meetings as you like. You can read part or all of the books, and participate as much or little as you like. The meetings take place on the third Sunday of each month at 10am Pacific Time.

## Recordings

Each book club is recorded, using Google Meet as the platform. The recordings are uploaded to YouTube and shared on this site. See the MEETING RECORDING links in the table below or view this [ai-book-club category](/category-ai-book-club/) on the site.

{:.note}
If you don't want to be recorded or have the recording shared on YouTube, this isn't the book club for you. By joining the book club, you consent to the recording. If you do need me to edit out part of the conversation, though, let me know and I will gladly make the edit.

## Reading schedule {#schedule}

The following tables list the reading schedule. The descriptions are extracts from the book summaries on Amazon. More details for the notes and discussion links will be added as the meeting date approaches.

He explores how different societies and political systems throughout history have wielded information to achieve their goals, for good and ill. And he addresses the urgent choices we face as non-human intelligence threatens our very existence."</p>

            <p class="book-summary">"[Hao] realized that the core truth of this massively disruptive sector is that its vision of success requires an almost unprecedented amount of resources: the “compute” power of high-end chips and the processing capacity to create massive large language models, the sheer volume of data that needs to be amassed at scale, the humans “cleaning up” that data for sweatshop wages throughout the Global South, and a truly alarming spike in the usage of energy and water underlying it all. The truth is that we have entered a new and ominous age of empire: only a small handful of globally scaled companies can even enter the field of play. At the head of the pack with its ChatGPT breakthrough, how would OpenAI resist such temptations?"</p>

Most experts already say that AI will have a devastating impact on blue-collar jobs. But Lee predicts that Chinese and American AI will have a strong impact on white-collar jobs as well. Is universal basic income the solution? In Lee's opinion, probably not.

The story focuses on the continuing rivalry of two key CEOs at the center of it all, who cultivated a religion around their mission to build god-like super intelligent machines: Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, and Demis Hassabis, the CEO of DeepMind."</p>

            <p class="book-summary">"<i>More Than Words</i> argues that generative AI programs like ChatGPT not only can kill the student essay but should, since these assignments don't challenge students to do the real work of writing. To Warner, writing is thinking—discovering your ideas while trying to capture them on a page—and feeling—grappling with what it fundamentally means to be human. The fact that we ask students to complete so many assignments that a machine could do is a sign that something has gone very wrong with writing instruction. More Than Words calls for us to use AI as an opportunity to reckon with how we work with words—and how all of us should rethink our relationship with writing."</p>

## Possible additional books {#additional_books}

Some possible additional books we might add to the schedule include the following:

* [The Atomic Human: What Makes Us Unique in the Age of AI](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Human-What-Makes-Unique/dp/1541705122), by Neil D. Lawrence
* [Machines of Loving Grace](https://darioamodei.com/machines-of-loving-grace), by Dario Amodei
* [Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right with Our AI Future](https://www.amazon.com/Superagency-Could-Possibly-Right-Future/dp/B0D5WMKV9H), by Reid Hoffman and Greg Beato

These are books that have been recommended by members. If you have a book to recommend, add it in the #recommend-books channel in Slack.

## Monthly meetings {#meetings}

The meetings are usually the *third Sunday of the month at 10am Pacific Time*. I realize that meeting on a Sunday might not work for many people &mdash; that's okay. This is a book club, not a tech comm webinar. The main focus will be the substance of these books. Only those who truly want to engage in the reading and discuss these topics will likely join, and that's all right.

## Slack online discussion forum {#slack}

There's a Slack workspace set up for online discussion. Go to one of these links:

* Already a workspace member? Go to [https://aibookclubtechcomm.slack.com](https://aibookclubtechcomm.slack.com/)
* Need to join the workspace? Go to [aibookclubtechcomm](https://join.slack.com/t/aibookclubtechcomm/shared_invite/zt-39vzdyzi9-MinrAVuVtCObhFIrpXdZBg)

The Slack workspace is used to chat, share info or other thoughts, etc. Feel free to introduce yourself in the Slack and ask questions. However, the main interaction will be with the monthly meetings.

## Email list {#emaillist}

In addition to Slack, there's an email list you can join to receive announcements, information, and other details. I'll try to post similar info on Slack, but email can be easier for people who don't have Slack open all the time.

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://app.mailjet.com/pas-nc-embedded-v1.js"></script>

## Google Meet for the meetings {#googlemeet}

For the monthly meetings, we use [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/). If you use Google Calendar, you can [join this Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/aibookclub-humanintheloop) and the meetings should automatically appear on your calendar. Otherwise, you can copy the event to your Google Calendar through [this link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=M2kwZmxubjB2aXVsNHZidmNrb25kOXZsbG5fMjAyNTA0MjBUMjEwMDAwWiB0b21qb2h0QG0&tmsrc=tomjoht%40gmail.com&scp=ALL) or by clicking this button:

## FAQ

**Who's the audience for this book club?**
: Mostly people working in tech comm who want to deepen and broaden their knowledge of AI, but who aren't looking to dive into the technical details of AI as an engineer might. These books fall more within a general interest category for technology and AI.

**How did you come up with the book list?**
: I look for books that are both popular and highly rated, so preferably books that have hundreds of reviews and average at least 4 stars. 

**What are the meetings like?**
: The meetings are interactive and discussion-based, as you might expect from any book club. To prepare for the book club meetings, I provide a notes document that summarizes the book's themes and also presents some questions for discussion. 

**Can I recommend a book?**
: Sure, send your book recommendations either to the [aibookclubtechcomm](https://aibookclubtechcomm.slack.com) or to me directly via the [contact form here](/contact).

**I'm not a technical writer -- can I still join?**
: Sure, you don't need to be a technical writer. I only added this facet to try to ground what is a broad domain (AI) with a more immediate and practical perspective.

**Isn't this field changing too fast for books?**
: Perhaps. However, many of these authors are wrestling with topics that go beyond the daily news headlines and which speak to long-term transitions in the way we think and work. 

**I'm not sure if I have time to read books.**
: There's a mental health benefit to reading long-form content instead of scrolling through bite-sized information nuggets. Reading books provides deeper engagement and a more satisfying experience for the brain. It takes time to read a 300-page book. That reading patience will offset a world where we're saturated with short-form content that reduces and fragments our attention spans.

## Glossary of key terms

**Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**
: Hypothetical AI that possesses human-level cognitive abilities and can understand, learn, and apply intelligence to any intellectual task, as opposed to narrow AI designed for specific tasks.

**Complexity Brake Theory**
: Proposed by Paul Allen, this theory argues that progress in understanding complex natural systems (like the human brain) is not exponential, but rather slows down as more layers of unforeseen complexity are discovered, acting as a brake on scientific discovery.

**Digital Immortality**
: The concept, envisioned by Kurzweil, where a person's consciousness, memories, and personality patterns (their "software") can be uploaded to a nonbiological substrate, allowing them to live indefinitely, free from the limitations of the biological body.

**Double Exponential Growth**
: A mechanism of LOAR where not only does technological progress grow exponentially, but the rate of that exponential growth itself also increases exponentially, fueled by increased investment and resources.

**Epochs (Six)**
: Kurzweil's grand historical narrative dividing cosmic evolution into six major paradigm shifts in information processing: Physics and Chemistry, Biology and DNA, Brains, Technology, The Merger of Human Technology with Human Intelligence (the Singularity), and The Universe Wakes Up.

**Genetics & Biotechnology**
: One of the GNR revolutions focused on reprogramming the code of life to eliminate disease, reverse aging, and optimize human biology.

**Grey Goo Scenario**
: A hypothetical doomsday scenario, often associated with nanotechnology, where out-of-control, self-replicating nanobots consume all biomass on Earth.

**Hard Problem of Consciousness**
: A philosophical term coined by David Chalmers referring to the difficulty of explaining how and why physical processes give rise to subjective experience, qualitative sensations, or phenomenal consciousness (e.g., the feeling of "redness").

**Law of Accelerating Returns (LOAR)**
: Ray Kurzweil's core principle positing that the fundamental measures of information technology follow a trajectory of predictable and exponential growth, with the rate of progress doubling at regular intervals.

**Large Language Models (LLMs)**
: Advanced AI models, like ChatGPT, that are trained on vast amounts of text data to understand, generate, and process human language, influencing the recent rapid advancements in AI.

**Longevity Escape Velocity**
: A point where, for every year that passes, medical science extends average life expectancy by more than a year, effectively making aging a solvable problem and leading to radical life extension.

**Moore's Law**
: An observation by Gordon Moore that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years. Kurzweil views it as just one of many "paradigm shifts" that sustain the overarching Law of Accelerating Returns in computation.

**Nanobots (Nanorobots)**
: Programmable, microscopic robots, envisioned by Kurzweil, that can navigate the bloodstream, act as a defense system, repair tissues, and eventually provide a physical link for brain-computer interfaces.

**Nanotechnology**
: One of the GNR revolutions focused on manipulating matter at the atomic and molecular scale to build structures, devices, and systems, including molecular manufacturing.

**Paradigm Shift**
: In Kurzweil's LOAR, a transition from one dominant technological method to another when the former reaches its limits, allowing the overall exponential growth curve to continue.

**Positive Feedback**
: A mechanism of LOAR where the more capable methods and tools resulting from one stage of technological progress are used to create the next, more advanced stage, forming a self-reinforcing cycle of acceleration.

**Robotics & Artificial Intelligence (AI)**
: One of the GNR revolutions, considered the most critical, involving the ascendance of nonbiological intelligence to human-level and beyond, leading to human-machine merger.

**The Singularity**
: As defined by Ray Kurzweil, "a future period during which the pace of technological change will be so rapid, its impact so deep, that human life will be irreversibly transformed," primarily through the merger of human and nonbiological intelligence.

**Techno-Utopianism**
: A belief or philosophy that advanced technology will bring about a utopian society, solving major societal problems like poverty, disease, and environmental damage, often overlooking potential negative consequences or social inequalities.

**Turing Test**
: A test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. Kurzweil predicts AI will pass a rigorous version of this by 2029.
