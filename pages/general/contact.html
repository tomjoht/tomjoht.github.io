{{tip}}For beginner questions, check out my answers to the <a href="http://idratherbewriting.com/2013/01/17/top-10-most-frequently-asked-questions-about-technical-writing/">top 10 most frequently asked questions about technical writing</a>. {{end}}

<p>I get a lot of email, so please give me a couple of days to respond. If I don't respond in a couple of days, ping me again to see if I received your email.</p>

<p>Also, sometimes people ask me questions that make for great blog posts. If I think your question would work great as a Question-and-Answer blog post, I'll let you know. By opening up your question for responses on my blog, you'll get much richer, more diverse responses.</p>

<b>Questions I don't respond to</b>

<p>Although I'm pretty open to people contacting me, I don't respond to the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You're taking a technical writing class and your teacher requires you to reach out to a professional technical writer with questions</li>
  <li>You want to publish a guest post but it's not related to technical writing and you're not a technical writer</li>
  <li>You're a recruiter trying to pitch me a new job opportunity that doesn't make at least $200k/year</li>
</ul>

<p>For your convenience, you can also contact me through the form below:</p>
