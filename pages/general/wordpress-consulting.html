<p><em>July 2013 Note: I'm pausing my WordPress consulting activities for the time being. Sorry.</em></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3201" title="WordPress Consulting" src="{{site.media}}/wordpressconsulting1.gif" alt="WordPress Consulting" width="125" height="125" /><a href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</a>, the most widely used open-source blogging software, gives you complete control over the design and display of your content. In addition to writing blog posts, WordPress allows you to create pages, add categories, customize your site design, define how posts appear, and more.</p>
<p>However, with WordPress's openly accessible code and advanced control over the design and functionality, many people find themselves in over their heads quickly. If you need help with a self-hosted WordPress blog, I offer various WordPressÂ consulting services.</p>
<h2>Customizing an Existing Theme</h2>
<p>If you're starting out with a new WordPress site, I recommend that you choose an existing theme and then have me alter it to fit your needs. There are thousands of WordPress themes already created, and it makes sense to start with an existing WordPress framework.</p>
<p>I have a developer membership with <a href="http://woothemes.com">woothemes.com</a>. Their themes are generally well-designed and supported, and many of them are responsive (meaning they display well on mobile devices). You can choose any theme from the woothemes.com site and I will implement it, customizing and altering it to fit your style preferences and needs. When I implement a wootheme, I won't charge you for the cost of the theme, only for its implementation. If you have a theme from another site, I can work with that as well, but I would add the cost of the theme into the project's cost.</p>
<h2>Building Themes from Scratch</h2>
<p>If you have a custom-designed site or brand that doesn't match any existing WordPress theme, I can create a theme from scratch to match your site or brand. Creating a WordPress theme from scratch usually requires quite a bit more work, so custom-created themes increase the cost of the project. However, custom themes are sometimes necessary when your regular website has features or functionality that don't transfer to WordPress easily, such as a store and shopping cart, or intricate functionality. The custom theme will integrate with your regular site in a seamless way across browsers.</p>
<h2>Making Site Modifications</h2>
<p>You may already have a WordPress site but just need some modifications. For example, maybe your site has been hacked and you need to increase the security. Maybe you want to change the design, integrating a new logo or color scheme. Maybe you want to customize the typography, the number of columns, the sidebar, or other areas. I can make all of these modifications to your theme to get it looking just how you want it.</p>
<h2>Small Jobs</h2>
<p>I do WordPress consulting as a side job to my regular job as a technical writer. As such, I specialize in small projects usually ranging between $100 to $1,500. If your site falls within this range, it can be a tremendous advantage for you. Other WordPress developers that do WordPress full-time may not bother to take on small projects within this range. But this is where I excel and can give you the most value. I will give your project the same time and attention as any large project.</p>
<h2>Video Tutorials</h2>
<p>Often when I'm working on a project, I'll create short little video tutorials to explain how various features work. For example, I might explain how to set and configure a theme's home page slider. These videos are usually well-received by clients, since the videos give them an immediate and easy understanding of how to work with the site. I can also provide live training over the phone to help you become familiar with the theme and how to post and update content.</p>
<h2>Ongoing Support</h2>
<p>Once I complete your WordPress project, I'm still available for support and questions. If you find, for example, that you want to add a certain plugin, or you need to upgrade your site to the latest WordPress version, or if something goes wrong with your web host, I'm available to respond to questions and help out.</p>
<p>One detail many users often fail to realize is the dynamic and constantly changing nature of the web. WordPress regularly updates its core software several times a year. Theme development companies such as woothemes update their themes several times a year as well. Many times these updates protect your site against security vulnerabilities, fix bugs, and introduce other improvements. I can provide regular maintenance services with your site to update WordPress and your theme, keeping you up to date with the latest versions.</p>
<h2>Costs</h2>
<p>Before beginning a project, I always give you an up-front estimate of the cost. I can give you a formal or informal estimate, depending on how much detail you know about the project before we begin. In general, I charge about $75 an hour. For a typical project, implementing a new theme from scratch or transferring an existing site to WordPress, the project cost might be between $300 to $600. The cost varies depending on the type of project and the work involved. If the project scope increases from the original estimate, I can let you know and make adjustments accordingly.</p>
<h2>Payment</h2>
<p>I transact all payment through Paypal. Paypal accepts Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, and Paypal itself. You can also submit payments through checks. I don't submit Paypal invoices to you until after the project is complete and you're satisfied with the result.</p>
<h2>WordPress Training</h2>
<p>I also offer training on WordPress. Do you need an introduction to WordPress, or an advanced tutorial? Using Adobe Connect to share screens and Skype for voice, I can give you a one-on-one tutorial covering everything you want to know. You can ask all the questions you want, and the topics we cover can be introductory, intermediate, or advanced -- all depending on you. The instruction can be tailored to your specific theme and web host, or more general, covering typical WordPress functionality. My fee for 1.5 hours of individual WordPress training is $99. I usually conduct these sessions on Saturday morning.</p>
