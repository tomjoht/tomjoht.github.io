For most questions, instead of reaching out to me, try these two channels first:

* **[Reddit Technical Writing subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalwriting/)**. This is a great space to ask beginner questions. You can also ask anonymous questions if you want.
* **[Write the Docs Slack](https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/)**. This is a popular space where a lot of technical writers interact, with many different channels. Here's a [direct link to Slack](https://writethedocs.slack.com).

On Write the Docs Slack, you can direct message me at my username, ["Tom Johnson"](https://writethedocs.slack.com/team/U0ES12W1F).

If you want to email me, you can do so at <a href="#" id="email-link" data-user="tomjoht" data-domain="gmail.com"></a>.
<script>
  (function() {
    var link = document.getElementById('email-link');
    var user = link.getAttribute('data-user');
    var domain = link.getAttribute('data-domain');
    link.href = 'mailto:' + user + '@' + domain;
    link.innerHTML = user + '@' + domain;
  })();
</script>
Give me a few days to get back to you. If you don't hear back after a week, reach out to me again.

* Questions about whether tech writing is a good career fit for you
* Requests to write guest posts that contain backlinks to your product
