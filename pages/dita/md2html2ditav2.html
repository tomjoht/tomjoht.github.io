<div class="body">
<p>This Markdown to DITA process is intended to support a workflow where you begin drafting documentation in Markdown as you gather content. When you're mostly finished authoring content, you can transform it all to DITA and then start working with it there.</p>
<p>Here's a quick looping video demo:</p>

<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Process Markdown to HTML</h2>
<p>To automate the conversion from Markdown to HTML:</p>
<ol class="ol">
<li class="li">
<p>Create a folder to store your project files. I'll call mine <code>ditaqrg</code>.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">Create a Markdown file and add it to this folder. Make sure it uses the <code>.md
          </code>extension.</li>
<li class="li">
<p>In this same folder, create a file named ditaqrg.sh (you can choose whatever name you want) and
            add this code:</p>
{% highlight xml %}<code>multimarkdown -f -b *.md
cd /Applications/oxygenAuthor_161/frameworks/dita/DITA-OT/plugins/h2d
ant -Dargs.input=/Users/tjohnson/projects/ditaqrg -Dargs.output=/Users/tjohnson/projects/ditaqrg
cd /users/tjohnson/projects/ditaqrg
</code>{% endhighlight %}
<p>Change “ditaqrg” to whatever project name you chose to use. You will need to customize the Oxygen
            h2d path and your input and output directories to match your specific locations. I
            explain this code in more detail below.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">
<p>Open Terminal and <code>cd</code> to your project folder. </p>
</li>
<li class="li">
<p>Type the following to change the permission to give read/write/execute to the file:</p>
{% highlight xml %}
chmod ugo+rwx ditaqrg.sh
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
<code>chmod</code> changes the file permissions. <code>ugo</code> stands for “user, group, others,” (these are the three groups that can access the file) and <code>rwx</code> means “read, write, execute”. Then we list the specific file we want to apply these permissions to (ditaqrg.sh).</p>
</li>
<li class="li">
<p>Type <code>ls -l ditaqrg.sh</code>. Verify that the file now has <code>rwxrwxrwx</code>
            permissions. (The <code>-l</code> adds more detail in the response.)</p>
</li>
<li class="li">
<p>Type <code>./projectname.sh</code> to run the file. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you look in the folder, you will see your .md files now have corresponding .html and .dita
        files.</p>
{{tip}} To run the command again in Terminal, press your up arrow key.{{end}}
<p>Note that each time you run the script, the Markdown files will overwrite the DITA files. If you don't want this automated process to keep overwriting the DITA files, remove the Markdown file.</p>
<div class="p">
{{warning}}If the HTML isn't valid, the DITA file will not be created. This can
          be somewhat subtle if you already have a DITA file. For example, if you make some edits to
          the Markdown file that produce invalid HTML, and then you run the script, it may appear to
          be working if you already have a DITA file there. Check to make sure the updates applied
          correctly.{{end}}
</p></div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Code explanation</h2>
<p>The heart of this transformation lies with this script:</p>
<div class="p">
{% highlight xml %}multimarkdown -f -b *.md
cd /Applications/oxygenAuthor_161/frameworks/dita/DITA-OT/plugins/h2d
ant -Dargs.input=/Users/tjohnson/projects/ditaqrg -Dargs.output=/Users/tjohnson/projects/ditaqrg
cd /users/tjohnson/projects/ditaqrg{% endhighlight %}
</p></div>
<p>What is this code doing? I'll go through it line by line. </p>
{% highlight xml %}multimarkdown -f -b *.md{% endhighlight %}
<p>First, the <code>multimarkdown</code> line will process your Markdown files into HTML
        by running the Fletcher script. The <code>-f</code> parameter says to create a full
        header in the HTML document. This means the HTML files will include the following:</p>
{% highlight xml %}<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8"/>
</head>
<body{% endhighlight %}
<p>This is necessary for the ant scripts to run. The <code>-b</code> runs a batch
        conversion, so it will process all files in the folder. The <code>*.md</code> restricts
        the conversion to any files with an .md extension, which is the traditional file extension
        for Markdown files.</p>
{% highlight xml %}cd /Applications/oxygenAuthor_161/frameworks/dita/DITA-OT/plugins/h2d{% endhighlight %}
<p>Now the script changes to the <code>h2d</code> directory. In this directory, you have a
        build.xml file supplied by OxygenXML that will convert your content from HTML to DITA.
        Customize this path to match your own OxygenXML installation directory. </p>
{% highlight xml %}ant -Dargs.input=/Users/tjohnson/projects/ditaqrg -Dargs.output=/Users/tjohnson/projects/ditaqrg{% endhighlight %}
<p>On this line, <code>ant</code> specifies input arguments for the HTML to DITA
        transformation. </p>
<p>Note that you must have an HTML file in the input directory for the script to work. If you
        don't, you'll see a message that says “build failed - could not create temp directory.” You
        don't need to manually create the temp directory – just put an HTML in the input
        directory.</p>
<p>If your HTML file were in this h2d folder, and your Terminal location was at the h2d folder
        path, you would now only need to type <code>ant</code> in the command line, and the
        build.xml file also located in this same folder would run the h2d transform to convert the
        HTML file to a DITA topic type. That's how ant works – when you type <code>ant</code> on
        the command line, it looks for a build.xml file in that same folder and executes the build
        file using the default arguments of the build.xml file.</p>
<p>However, it's unlikely that you want to store all your Markdown files and HTML files in
        this deeply nested Oxygen installation directory. In this example, we add some arguments to
        the ant parameter to specify a different input and output directory from the default
        settings.</p>
<p>
<p>The <code>-Dargs.input</code> specifies the directory containing the files you want to
        transform. If you point to the directory, all Markdown files in that directory will be
        processed. If you point to a specific file, only that file will be processed.</p>
<p>The <code>-Dargs.output</code> specifies the output directory for the transformed
        files. In this case, I want them to be output to the same directory as the Markdown
        files.</p>
<p>There's another argument you might want to add: <code>Dargs.infotype</code>. This
        argument specifies the topic type to convert the HTML into. Options here include
          <code>topic</code>, <code>task</code>, <code>concept</code>, or
          <code>reference</code>. The default (if you don't specify the option) is
          <code>topic</code>. So you actually don't need this argument if you're just converting
        to topics, which is what I recommend.</p>
<p>There's are some more arguments to be aware of:
        <code>args.include.subdirs=“yes”</code>. This argument says to look in subdirectories
        for files. I don't use subdirectories to organize my DITA files (except for images), so this
        argument isn't that relevant. If you don't specify this argument, the default value is
        “no”.</p>
<p>Two other arguments include the default language and the XSL file. The arguments are
        defined in <a class="xref external" href="http://dita-ot.sourceforge.net/1.5.2/readme/DITA-h2d-ant.html" target="_blank">Migrating HTML to DITA with Ant script</a>. Note that in
        that article, it shows the following:</p>
{% highlight xml %}
<code>ant -Dargs.input={file|direcotry} -Dargs.output={direcotry} -Dargs.infotype={topic|concept|task|reference}
</code>
{% endhighlight %}
<p>The "direcotry" misspellings are not mine. Also, the file never explains that
        "{file|directory}" means you can enter either the file <em class="ph i">or</em> directory, and also that
        you omit the <code>{}</code> tags.</p>
{% highlight xml %}cd /users/tjohnson/projects/ditaqrg{% endhighlight %}
<p>After the script runs, we return to the same directory we were in at the beginning. You can
        type <code>ls</code> to list the contents of the directory. You will then see a .dita
        file corresponding to each HTML file in the directory. If you group your files by kind, you
        won't see the files in triplicate as you browse them.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title sectiontitle">Limitations</h2>
<p>You can't use DITA markup within Markdown and have it survive the transforms. For example, if you put a <code>note</code> element in your Markdown script, it will not survive the conversion to DITA.</p>
