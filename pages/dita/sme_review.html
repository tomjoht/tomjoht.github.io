<h1 class="title topictitle1">DITA: Handling SME review</h1>
<div class="body conbody">
<p class="shortdesc">To handle SME review of content, you have a number of options. However, the most<br />
  efficient review process allows for the following:</p>
<div class="p">
<ul class="ul" id="concept_yb3_slc_s4__ul_elh_jyv_x4">
<li class="li">The ability to iterate on the content during review (based on incoming feedback) so you can<br />
     update topics before other reviewers begin their review. </li>
<li class="li">The ability for reviewers to interface with each other via comments.</li>
<li class="li">Historical comments so other reviewers can see the evolution of the content.</li>
<li class="li">Presentation of the content in the same form that users will view it in (rather than a<br />
     rendered PDF or Word document).</li>
<li class="li">The ability for reviewers to review the content asynchronously on their own schedules and<br />
     times. </li>
<li class="li">The ability for reviewers to see the updates you've already made to the content so they know<br />
     their recommendations don't fall on deaf ears.</li>
<li class="li">The ability for reviewers to continue their review post-release since people are usually<br />
     busy up until release time.</li>
</ul></div>
<p class="p">Based on this criteria, probably the best way to review DITA content is through Oxygen's<br />
   Webhelp with Feedback output. This provides a comment section at the bottom of topics that allows<br />
   people to comment on the topic, read others' comments, allows authors to reply to comments,<br />
   allows for notifications that stimulate conversation, and more.</p>
<p class="p">For details on creating the webhelp with feedack theme, see <a class="xref" href="/webhelp_with_feedback" title="You can enable commenting below your webhelp topics by selecting the Webhelp with Feedback skin.">DITA: Webhelp with Feedback</a>.</p>
