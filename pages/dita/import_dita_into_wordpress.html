<p class="shortdesc">The DITA XHTML Import tool allows you to import DITA-produced XHTML content into a<br />

<p class="p">This tool is a slight modification from the original tool created by <a class="xref external" href="http://journalized.zed1.com/wordpress-plugins/dita-to-wordpress-import-tool/" target="_blank">Mike Little here</a>. I have made a few<br />
                modifications with the way links and images are handled. Additionally, I have unique<br />
                installation instructions here. (Note that this is not a plugin -- it's a file you<br />
                add to your WordPress instance that allows you to import XHTML files from DITA.</p>

<h2 class="title topictitle2">Some notes about the DITA Import tool</h2>
<div class="body taskbody">
<div class="section">
<h3 class="title sectiontitle">What it imports</h3>
<p class="p">The DITA XHTML import tool does not import raw DITA. Instead, it takes the XHTML output from DITA<br />
                    and imports it into WordPress. It works similarly to a regular HTML import tool,<br />
                    such as <a class="xref external" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/import-html-pages/" target="_blank">HTML Import 2</a>,<br />
                    except that this tool preserves the hierarchy (but not the order) of<br />
                    parent-child pages as expressed in your ditamap table of contents file, among<br />
                    other things.</p>
<p class="p">Despite the lack of sibling order, this turns out not to be a problem at all, because rather than<br />
                    trying to display pages by virtue of their page order in WordPress, we instead<br />
                    display them using the index file that is included in the DITA XHTML navigation<br />
                    (more details are below).</p>
<p class="p">What's cool about this tool, and what distinguishes it from other import tools, is that if you<br />
                    reimport your DITA XHTML content, the previous pages aren't duplicated or<br />
                    recreated. Instead, only a new <em class="ph i">version</em> of the page is created, and any<br />
                    comments or other histories about the page are preserved.</p>
<p class="p">Also, you don't have to reimport your <em class="ph i">entire</em> help set each time you want to update your<br />
                    content. You can just update the pages that have changed. However, even<br />
                    importing one page will require the importer to look at all the other pages in<br />
                    WordPress. The importer looks to see if any of the existing files have<br />
                    permalinks that match the file names of the content you're importing. </p>
<p class="p">The globally unique identifier, or guid, between incoming files and existing<br />
                    WordPress pages is the permalink. If the imported content's file name matches an<br />
                    existing page's permalink, the imported file creates a new version of that<br />
                    existing page. If the file name doesn't match the existing permalink, a new page<br />
                    is created. </p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h3 class="title sectiontitle">Deleting pages</h3>
<p class="p">If you delete a page in your DITA source that you had previously imported into<br />
                    WordPress, the importer won't know that the file should be deleted -- you'll<br />
                    need to manually delete the legacy page from WordPress. There isn't any kind of<br />
                    import manifest file that looks to see if WordPress has any pages it shouldn't.<br />
                    This is because you can have both DITA-imported pages and native pages created<br />
                    directly from WordPress living in the same directory.</p>
<p class="p">If you change your DITA file names and reimport your content, the newly<br />
                    imported files won't match any WordPress pages with permalinks corresponding to<br />
                    the previous DITA file name, hence new pages will be created/duplicated. As a<br />
                    best practice, avoid changing file names or permalinks.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h3 class="title sectiontitle">Navigation</h3>
<p class="p">Even though the parent-child hierarchy is preserved, the order of siblings is not<br />
                    preserved. This makes it difficult to automate menus using WordPress' built-in<br />
                    menu system. However, don't fear! I've overcome the menu issue with some clever<br />
                    scripting and CSS.</p>
<p class="p">Basically, by following the steps in the sections below, you'll identify the table of<br />
                    contents file, pull it into a widget, and add a class at the top. Some jQuery<br />
                    scripts will trigger based on the class, and when you view the site in your<br />
                    browser, you'll have a sweet-looking navigation bar.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h3 class="title sectiontitle">Links</h3>
<p class="p">In order for external links to be absolute instead of relative, you must add<br />
                        <samp class="ph codeph">outputclass="external"</samp> on the link in the DITA source file.<br />
                    If you look in the ditaimporter.php file, you'll see my hack for making the<br />
                    links work. It looks like this: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock language-php">
       $cls = $a-&gt; getAttribute(<span class="hl-string" style="color:#2a00ff">'class'</span>);

	$href = $a-&gt; getAttribute(<span class="hl-string" style="color:#2a00ff">'href'</span>);
	<strong class="hl-keyword" style="color:#7f0055">if</strong> (!<strong class="hl-keyword" style="color:#7f0055">empty</strong>($href) &amp;&amp; ( ($cls == <span class="hl-string" style="color:#2a00ff">'xref'</span> &amp;&amp; $cls == <span class="hl-string" style="color:#2a00ff">'link'</span>) || ($cls == <span class="hl-string" style="color:#2a00ff">'xref'</span>) || ($cls == <span class="hl-string" style="color:#2a00ff">'link'</span>) || ($cls == null ) ) ) {
                $href = $this-&gt;HELP_ROOT_PATH . <span class="hl-string" style="color:#2a00ff">'/'</span> . $this-&gt; processFilenameToId($href); <em class="hl-comment" style="color:#006400">// hard coded -- BAD</em>
                $a-&gt; setAttribute(<span class="hl-string" style="color:#2a00ff">'href'</span>, $href);
	} 

	<strong class="hl-keyword" style="color:#7f0055">elseif</strong> (!<strong class="hl-keyword" style="color:#7f0055">empty</strong>($href) &amp;&amp; ($cls == <span class="hl-string" style="color:#2a00ff">'external'</span> &amp;&amp; $cls == <span class="hl-string" style="color:#2a00ff">'xref'</span>) ) {
		  $href = $this-&gt;processFilenameToId($href); <em class="hl-comment" style="color:#006400">// hard coded -- BAD</em>
                $a-&gt; setAttribute(<span class="hl-string" style="color:#2a00ff">'href'</span>, $href);
	}
                </pre>
<p class="p">This code says if the class is <samp class="ph codeph">xref</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">link</samp>,<br />
                or <samp class="ph codeph">xref</samp>, or <samp class="ph codeph">link</samp>, or <samp class="ph codeph">null</samp>, then<br />
                process the link as a relative link. But if it has a class of<br />
                    <samp class="ph codeph">external</samp>, then process as an absolute link. If you don't put<br />
                    <samp class="ph codeph">outputclass="external"</samp> as an attribute on an external link,<br />
                then the importer will render it as a relative link, and the path won't be<br />
                right.</p>
<p class="p">By the way, as far as I can tell, these classes are how DITA's OT renders link<br />
                    classes. But if it turns out that the DITA OT adds other classes to internal<br />
                    links, let me know and I'll fix the logic.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h3 class="title sectiontitle">Paragraph breaks</h3>
<p class="p">When the DITA content imports into WordPress, there will be a lot of blank spaces.<br />
                You must disable WordPress' autoparagraphing function (<a class="xref external" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wpautop" target="_blank">wpautop</a>) in order to avoid odd line breaks in your<br />
                document, since WordPress's editor treats line breaks as new paragraphs. Once you<br />
                disable wpautop, you will need to add paragraph tags to signal new paragraphs in<br />
                your content. </p>
<p class="p">This shouldn't be a problem if you are importing your content into WordPress.<br />
                    However, if you have a lot of pages that you're authoring natively in WordPress,<br />
                    which co-exist side-by-side your imported DITA-authored pages, then you might<br />
                    want to implement a plugin such as <a class="xref external" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpautop-control/" target="_blank">wpautop control</a>, which lets you turn on wpautop on a<br />
                    page-by-page basis.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h3 class="title sectiontitle">WP Multisite versus standalone WP</h3>
<p class="p">You can use this DITA import tool with WordPress multisite, not just with standalone<br />
                WordPress sites. In many cases, it probably makes a lot more sense to use WordPress<br />
                multisite. If you have just one output, then you're probably not using DITA in the<br />
                first place. On the other hand, if you have numerous WordPress sites, because you're<br />
                single sourcing your content into various channels, it makes more sense to publish<br />
                each output as a separate site in a WordPress network that you manage centrally. </p>
<p class="p">WordPress multisite allows you to maintain the theme and plugins across your network<br />
                in one place rather than making updates to each site individually. That is, all<br />
                sites in the network can refer to the same theme, plugins, and WP core files. When<br />
                you need to make updates, you only have to do it once even if you have hundreds of<br />
                sites in your network. Even if you have just two sites, you definitely want to use<br />
                WordPress Multisite. What's cool is that both standalone Wordpress and WordPress<br />
                multisite run off the same core code base.</p>
<p class="p">For instructions on using WP multisite, see <a class="xref external" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network" target="_blank">Create a network</a> on the WordPress Codex. I also highly<br />
                    recommend getting a subscription to <a class="xref external" href="http://premium.wpmudev.org/" target="_blank">wpmudev</a>, which is a site specializing<br />
                    in plugins and assistance with wpmudev. </p>
<p class="p">(By the way, my instructions here don't include info on installing either <a class="xref external" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress" target="_blank">standalone WordPress</a> or <a class="xref external" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network" target="_blank">WordPress multisite</a>, but you can easily find<br />
                    tutorials online. Also, if you're a total Wordpress newbie, note that you<br />
                    download the self-hosted WordPress from <a class="xref external" href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress.org</a>, not <a class="xref external" href="https://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">WordPress.com</a>. You won't be able to use this tool with<br />
                    WordPress.com. You'll need to have your own space on a web host.)</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h3 class="title sectiontitle">Styles</h3>
<p class="p">The tool doesn't have any pre-built CSS styles for the DITA classes that will be in<br />
                    your content. However, if you use the styles I've included here for your theme,<br />
                    it will look decent.</p>
</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h3 class="title sectiontitle">Images</h3>
<p class="p">You don't need to do anything special in order for your images to import. They are pulled<br />
                in to your media library when you import content.</p>

                    default table of contents created for the DITA XHTML output) as your TOC<br />
                    (toc.html).
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Don't bother trying to manage your menu system<br />

                        and energy to keep up, since each time you change your DITA content<br />

                        Basically you'll incorporate a jQuery accordion plugin that will read the<br />
                        file structure of the toc.html file and apply a navigation menu. You'll pull<br />
                        this page into a sidebar widget. Only the first import will require some<br />
                        configuration -- you'll need to get the page ID and insert it into the<br />
                        sidebar widget. With each subsequent import, you won't need to make any<br />
                        adjustments.</p>

                                plugin will require you to create a menu in Wordpress, which is not<br />
                                something that we can import through the DITA Import tool. If you<br />
                                create a menu in WordPress, it will be out of sync with the DITA<br />

<p class="p">If you read about the jQuery plugin, you'll see that I'm not using<br />
                                    <samp class="ph codeph">#accordion</samp> to trigger the plugin. Why not?<br />
                                Well, when the DITA OT converts the ditamap to an index file, it<br />
                                strips away all classes. In other tutorials (such as the <a class="xref" href="/jquery_side_panel" title="You can add a sliding side panel that appears when someone clicks a link. This is particularly useful for code samples where you want to elaborate more with comments but don't have the space to do so.">DITA: Add an expanding side pane (Sidr)</a>), I explained how you can edit<br />
                                certain source files in OxygenXML to allow classes to pass through.<br />
                                Unfortunately, these same edits don't affect the classes in the<br />
                                ditamap. No worries, though. We select the right element through a<br />
                                child combinator selection (<samp class="ph codeph">#tocPage<br />
                                    ul:nth-child(1)</samp>). This selects the first list that<br />
                                appears after the <samp class="ph codeph">#tocPage</samp> ID.</p>
<p class="p">Also note that if you read about the options available in the jQuery plugin, you'll see that I've specified some here: </p>
<pre class="pre codeblock">eventType: 'click',
autoClose: true,
saveState: true,
disableLink: true,
speed: 'fast'                      </pre>
<p class="p">Of note here are the <samp class="ph codeph">saveState</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">autoClose</samp> options. The<br />
                                    <samp class="ph codeph">saveState</samp> option means when a user opens a menu<br />
                                and reloads the page, or actually goes to the page (meaning the site<br />
                                reloads), that menu stays open. You want this<br />
                                    <samp class="ph codeph">saveState</samp> option set to <samp class="ph codeph">true</samp><br />
                                so the user knows where he or she is at in the nav menu. (The<br />
                                jquery.cookie.js file allows for the <samp class="ph codeph">saveState</samp><br />
                                option to work.)</p>
<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">autoClose</samp> option determines whether the other<br />
                            sections close when you open another section (the accordion feature).<br />
                            Traditional accordions close other sections when you navigate them. I<br />
                            think leaving each section open makes the TOC menu look too big. You can<br />
                            read the Design Chemic documentation for the plugin to see what the<br />
                            other options control.</p>
<div class="p">
<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Unfortunately there's a glitch with the TOC that I didn't<br />
                                    realize. If you click a link in a topic that opens another<br />
                                    topic, that newly opened topic isn't automatically highlighted<br />

<h3 class="title topictitle3">Turn off revisions</h3>
<div class="body taskbody">
<div class="section context">
<p class="p">You want to turn off revisions so that each time you import content, WordPress doesn't keep<br />
                        adding revisions. I'm not entirely sure, but I think if you keep adding<br />
                        revisions, you soon begin to see a ton of guid updates for each revision in<br />
                        the system. At any rate, you don't want to unnecessarily increase the size<br />
                        of your database anyway.</p>
<p class="p">It's much better if you simply turn off the revision feature in WordPress. You<br />
                        aren't storing your content here anyway. You're uploading it and overwriting<br />
                        it with each upload. Your source DITA content should be stored in a version<br />
                        control repository such as github, subversion, or mercurial. </p>
<div class="p">To turn off revisions in WordPress, add this in your wp-config.php file (which is<br />
                        in your WordPress root<br />
                        directory).

<p class="p">When you transform DITA into HTML, the OT inserts a lot of classes into the<br />

                        that addresses those classes. I've added a number of classes to both the Twenty Twelve theme and the jQuery navigation plugin that correspond with these classes. </p>
