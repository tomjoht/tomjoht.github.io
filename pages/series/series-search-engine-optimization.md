summary: "<p>In this series, I tackle search engine optimization (SEO) as it relates to technical writing. Although there is a lot of information online about methods for SEO, few experts explore the issues in the context of a technical writer’s world.</p><p>Challenges such as duplicate content from single sourced material, iframes from tripane help, keyword optimization when application terminology conflicts with a user’s terminology are all challenges that technical writers must wrestle with as they try to increase the SEO value of their help material to turn their instructional topics into business assets that both attract new customers searching for industry keywords as well as existing customers troubleshooting solutions.</p>"
