summary: "In this series, I explore the friction between structured authoring and web publishing as I try to wrangle DITA authored content into WordPress. WordPress epitomizes one of the most commonly used web CMS platforms for publishing content and makes up about a quarter of the websites online. DITA is the structured authoring staple for tech comm, but its tripane outputs usually look dated and old-fashioned. How can we merge these worlds?"
