title: "Series: 7 Deadly Sins of Blogging"
permalink: /series-overview-blogging-sins/
summary: "<p>Blogging consists of more than just writing on a specific topic. Blogging also includes certain characteristics that set it apart from other forms of writing. On a blog, you’re expected to be more transparent, honest, and frank. You tell stories and share personal experiences.</p><p>At the same time, you have to avoid revealing information that is too personal (which might violate the trust of those around you), or which would violate corporate privacy at work. You also have the interactive aspects of responding to comments, following your readers’ blogs, promoting your content via social channels, dealing with spam, configuring your own publishing platform, and more. In this series, I cover these characteristics of blogging through the 7 deadly sins framework.</p>"
