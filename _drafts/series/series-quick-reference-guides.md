summary: "The names can vary — “Cheat Sheet,” “Getting Started,” “Fast Track,” “Job Aid” — but the concept is the same. Condense the most important information into one double-sided page. By “condense” I don't mean shrink the font to 6 pt., decrease the leading, and eliminate all white space. With the quick reference guide, you take something that's robust and complex, and distill it down to its essence, but distill it in a way that brings perfect clarity to users. Quick reference guides are like the poetry of technical writing."
