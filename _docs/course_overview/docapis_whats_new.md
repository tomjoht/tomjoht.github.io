If you're looking to see what's new in the API doc site/course, you can browse new content in several ways.

* TOC
{:toc}

<h2>Most recent updates</h2>

See the [api-doc-site-updates category](https://idratherbewriting.com/category-api-doc-site-updates/) on my blog. I describe the updates I'm making here, often with commentary about why I made the update.

## Seeing what content has been updated

To see the history of page, click the GitHub button next to the timestamp on the page:

<img class="small_medium" src="{{site.api_media}}/github_button_whats_new.png" alt="GitHub button" />

This takes you to the file in GitHub. In GitHub, click the History link:

<img class="small_medium" src="{{site.api_media}}/github_history_view.png" alt="GitHub History" />

{% include random_ad2.html %}

Then click the commit IDs to browse file diffs for the commits that include the file:

<img class="small_medium" src="{{site.api_media}}/github_commit_ids.png" alt="GitHub commit IDs" />

You can see the [stream of commits in GitHub here](https://github.com/tomjoht/tomjoht.github.io/commits/main).
