In this course on writing documentation for APIs, instead of just talking about abstract concepts, I contextualize APIs with a direct, hands-on approach. You'll first learn about API documentation by using a simple weather API to put a weather forecast on your site.

As you use the API, you'll learn about endpoints, parameters, data types, authentication, curl, JSON, the command line, Chrome's Developer Console, JavaScript, and more. The idea is that rather than learning about these concepts independent of any context, you learn them by immersing yourself in a real scenario while using an API. Immersion in real scenarios makes these tools and technologies more meaningful.

We'll then transition into standards, tools, and specifications for REST APIs. You'll learn about the required sections in API documentation, analyze examples of REST API documentation from various companies, learn how to join an open-source project to get experience, and more.

## About REST APIs

In a nutshell, REST APIs (which are a type of web API) involve requests and responses, not too unlike visiting a web page. You make a request to a resource stored on a server, and the server responds with the requested information. The protocol used to transport the data is HTTP. "REST" stands for Representational State Transfer.

<figure><img class="docimage large" src="{{site.api_media}}/restapi_apidoc.svg" alt="Response and request model for REST APIs" /><figcaption>REST APIs involve requests and responses over HTTP protocol</figcaption></figure>

I dive more into the principles of REST in [What is a REST API?](docapis_what_is_a_rest_api.html) In REST API documentation, you describe the various endpoints available, their methods, parameters, and other details, and you also document sample responses from the endpoints.

## From practice to documentation

In this course, after you practice [using an API like a developer](likeadeveloper.html), you'll then shift perspectives and "become a technical writer" tasked with [documenting a new endpoint](docendpoints.html) that engineers added to an API. As a technical writer, you'll tackle each element of a reference topic in REST API documentation:

1. [Resource descriptions](docapis_resource_descriptions.html)
2. [Endpoints and methods](docapis_resource_endpoints.html)
3. [Parameters](docapis_doc_parameters.html)
4. [Request example](docapis_doc_sample_requests.html)
5. [Response example](docapis_doc_sample_responses_and_schema.html)

Exploring each of these sections will give you a solid understanding of how to document REST APIs. You'll also learn how to document the [conceptual sections for an API](docconceptual.html), such as the [getting started tutorial](docapis_doc_getting_started_section.html), [product overview](docapis_doc_overview.html), [status and error codes](docapis_doc_status_codes.html), [request authorization](docapis_more_about_authorization.html), and more.

{% include random_ad2.html %}

You'll also dive into different ways to [publish REST API documentation](publishingapis.html), exploring tools and specifications such as [GitHub](pubapis_github_wikis.html), static site generators like [Jekyll](pubapis_jekyll.html), and other [docs-as-code approaches](pubapis_docs_as_code.html). You'll learn how to leverage templates, build interactive API consoles so users can try out requests and see responses, and learn how to manage your content through [version control](pubapis_version_control.html).

We'll also dive into specifications such as the [OpenAPI specification](pubapis_openapi_tutorial_overview.html) and [Swagger UI](pubapis_openapi_intro.html) (which provides tooling for the OpenAPI specification). Additionally, you'll learn how to [document native library APIs](nativelibraryapis.html) and generate [Javadoc](nativelibraryapis_create_javadoc.html).

Tech writing is about more than tools and technology, though. As such, I even explore [processes and methodologies](docapis_managing_doc_processes.html) in depth, explaining how to manage both [large](docapis_managing_doc_projects.html) and [small](docapis_managing_small_doc_requests.html) documentation projects, how to [collect documentation feedback](docapis_collecting_feedback_post_release.html), [how to keep stakeholders happy and updated](docapis_status_reports.html), and more.

I've also included a section on [metrics and measurement](docapis_measuring_impact.html), which lists a comprehensive [quality checklist](docapis_quality_checklist.html). The criteria described can help you evaluate your own developer portal in myriad ways against industry best practices.

Throughout this course, I put these concepts in real, applicable contexts with hands-on activities and demos.

## Who the course is for

The course primarily serves the following audiences:

* Professional technical writers looking to transition from traditional documentation into more API-focused documentation for developers.
* Students learning how to prepare themselves technically to succeed in the tech comm field, which is becoming more focused on developer documentation.
* Developers who are documenting their own APIs and want to know best practices for structure, terminology, and style with tech docs.
* Educators who are training technical writing students about API documentation practices and technologies.

## Course organization {#course_organization}

The course consists of the following sections:

{: .tip}
You can [download a PDF of this course here](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/learnapidoc/e/146076). The download includes a comprehensive PDF of the entire course (900+ pages) as well as individual chapter PDFs, which are more practical for printing. The chapter PDFs are all under 10MB, which means you can also upload them into [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai) or other AI tools with large input allowances and interact with the information that way.

## Sequence and activities

You don't have to read the sections in order &mdash; feel free to skip around as you prefer. Some of the earlier sections (such as the section on [Using a REST API like a developer](likeadeveloper.html) and [Documenting endpoints](docendpoints.html)) follow a somewhat sequential order with the same [weather API scenario](docapis_scenario_for_using_weather_api.html), but by and large you can jump around as desired.

Because the purpose of the course is to help you learn, there are many activities that require hands-on coding and other exercises. Along with the learning activities, there are also conceptual deep dives, but the focus is always on *learning by doing*. Where there are hands-on activities, I typically include this icon in the section title: <i class="fa fa-user-circle"></i>. Other topics have the word "Activity" in the title. The activities are integrated into various sections, but you can also see many of the activities in the [Workshop Activities](workshop.html). These are the activities we do during live workshops.

{% include ads.html %}

I refer to the content here as a "course" instead of a book or a website, primarily because I include a lot of exercises throughout in each section, and I find that people who want to learn API documentation prefer a more hands-on "course" experience. Below each topic is a progress indicator that reminds you to keep moving through the course.

## How long will it take to finish the course?

Don't be daunted if you never make it entirely through the course. If printed to PDF, the content is about 900 pages. And I keep adding to the content, refining it, rearranging and adjusting it as I see fit and as I grow my experience and awareness. It's a living document. Almost no one really finishes the course from beginning to end because by the time they do, I'll have added new content.

{% include image_ad_right.html %}

Also, you should only focus on those sections that you need to learn. See this Reddit post, [Has anyone here completed the idratherbewriting API writing course by Tom Johnson?](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalwriting/comments/ropvtx/has_anyone_here_completed_the_idratherbewriting/). For someone already familiar with many concepts, they can breeze through the course in less than a week. For someone new to API documentation, they might spend many months making their way through the course. If you keep finding value in the content, take as long as you want. If you don't find yourself learning anything, skip forward.

## Will this course help you get a job in API documentation?

The most common reason people take this course is to transition into API documentation. This course will help you make that transition, but you can't just passively read through the content. You need to do the activities outlined in each section, especially those topics that involve working with content from an [open-source project](docapis_find_open_source_project.html) (or something similar). These activities are crucial to building experience and credibility with a portfolio. I provide more details in [Getting an API documentation job and thriving](jobapis.html). Without a strong portfolio to demonstrate your writing expertise, almost no manager will hire you, even if you have an extensive tech background.

## No programming skills required

As for the needed technical background for the course, you don't need any programming background or other prerequisites, but it will help to know some basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

If you do have some familiarity with programming concepts, you might speed through some of the sections and jump ahead to the topics you want to learn more about. This course assumes you're a beginner, though.

Some of the code samples in this course use JavaScript. JavaScript may or may not be a language that you actually use when you document REST APIs, but most likely there will be some programming language or platform that becomes important to know.

JavaScript is one of the most useful and easy languages to become familiar with, so it works well in code samples for this introduction to REST API documentation. JavaScript allows you to test code by merely opening it in your browser (rather than compiling it in an IDE). (I have a [quick crash-course in JavaScript here](https://idratherbewriting.com/javascript/) if you need it.)

{% include random_ad4.html %}

## What you'll need {#what_you_need}

Here are a few tools you'll need to do the activities in this course:

* **Computer.** You need a computer (if attending the live workshop, a laptop and charging cord), as there are many activities to work through.
* **Text editor**. If you don't already have a favorite text editor, download [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/), as it works well on both Mac and Windows and is free. If you have another text editor you prefer (e.g., [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or even [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)), that will work too. Just make sure you can write code in plain text.
* **Chrome browser**. [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) provides a Javascript Console that works well for inspecting JSON, so we'll be using Chrome. Also, in order to read JSON responses more easily in the browser, install the [JSON Formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en) Chrome extension.
* **Postman**. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is an app that allows you to make requests and see responses through a visual client. *Make sure you download the app and not the Chrome extension.*
* **curl**. [curl](https://curl.se/) is essential for making requests to endpoints from the command line. Mac already has curl built-in, but it might not be available by default on Windows. (Some Windows 10 builds already have it in Powershell.) On Windows, open a Command Prompt and type `curl -V`. If it's not installed, go to [https://curl.se/windows/](https://curl.se/windows/) and install a version. Close and re-open your Command Prompt and try typing `curl -V` again.
* **Git**. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control tool developers often use to collaborate on code. For Windows, see [https://gitforwindows.org/](https://gitforwindows.org/) to set up Git and the Git BASH terminal emulator. For Mac, see [Downloading Git](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).
* **GitHub account**. [GitHub](https://github.com) will be used for various activities, sometimes to demonstrate the Git workflow and other times as an authentication service for developer tools. If you don't already have a GitHub account, sign up for one.
* **OpenAPI Editor**. When working with the OpenAPI specification, we'll use an OpenAPI editor. You can use [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) (free, web-based), [Visual Studio Code with OpenAPI extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=openapi&target=VSCode&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Relevance), or [Postman's API Builder](https://www.postman.com/product/api-builder/) (which includes OpenAPI support). These tools provide visual modeling capabilities for working with the OpenAPI specification.
* **OpenWeatherMap API key**. We'll be using the OpenWeatherMap API for some exercises. It takes a couple of hours for the OpenWeatherMap API key to become active, so it's best if you get the API key ahead of time &mdash; then when you get to the OpenWeatherMap API activities, you'll be all set. To get your (free) OpenWeatherMap API key, go to [https://openweathermap.org/](https://openweathermap.org/). Click Sign Up in the top nav bar and create an account. After you sign up, OpenWeatherMap sends you an API key to your email. you can also find it when you log in and click the API Keys tab from the dashboard. Copy the key into a place you can easily find it.

{: .note}
**Modern Tools Note**: While this course focuses on fundamental concepts, you may also encounter modern tools like GitHub Copilot, VS Code extensions, and AI-powered documentation tools. These can enhance your workflow but aren't required for the core learning objectives.

## Testing Your Setup

In the past, people have asked for some tests to check whether their laptops are correctly set up.

* If you want to test whether Postman works, open up the Postman app and paste this into the GET box: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip=95050&units=imperial&appid=YOUR_API_KEY`. Then click **Send**. If you get a response, it's working correctly. (In rare cases, sometimes people have security restrictions on their computers that block all network access.)
* If you want to test whether curl is installed, open Terminal (on Mac) or Command Prompt (on Windows) and paste in `curl --get "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip=95050&units=imperial&appid=YOUR_API_KEY"`. If you get a JSON response, you're good.
* To check whether Git is installed, open up Terminal (on Mac) or Command Prompt (on Windows) and type `git --version`. If it's installed, you'll see the version.

## Video recordings

For video recordings of this course, see the [Video recordings of API doc workshops](docapis_course_videos.html). The page lists the most recent video recordings available. The video doesn't go into the same level of detail as the written material, but it would be a good start.

See my [Upcoming Presentations](https://idratherbewriting.com/presentations/) on my blog for details about future workshops and presentations.

## Course slides

For the live workshops, I have various slides that cover different sections of this course. See [Course Slides](workshop.html) for the links. The slides use [RevealJS](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/), which is an HTML/CSS/JS framework for slides. The images are single-sourced between the site and the slides, so they'll more likely stay in sync.

## Copyright and re-use of materials

Some people have asked whether they can use materials from this course to give their own API documentation workshops. I only allow the material to be used for non-profit workshops where the workshop leader isn't charging participants for the instruction. Of course, many of the ideas and concepts in this course aren't specific or unique to me, and you're entitled to fair use. However, please don't just hijack my site's materials, activities, and other information for your own commercial endeavors.

If you're a teacher at a college or university (or high school) and are trying to teach APIs and developer docs to your students, feel free to use this site as part of your instructional materials. I appreciate links back to the site and attribution as needed (links pointing to my site boost search engine rankings). My larger goal for this site is to help educate and empower tech writers with developer documentation strategies, workflows, and best practices. If you'd like to share your API documentation course syllabus, [contact me](https://idratherbewriting.com/contact/) and I'll add a link here.

## Is this course really free?

Yes, this course is entirely free. I only charge for the PDF. [Advertising](https://idratherbewriting.com/advertising) also helps make this content free, so you will see little text snippets and other ads on the course pages promoting links to API service providers. Sometimes I also include sponsored pages as well to highlight a vendor's particular offerings. Whenever content is sponsored, I note that on the page. I also wouldn't include any content in the course that didn't meet my standards or which I wouldn't recommend.

If you'd like to give back, feel support me by [buying the PDF of the course](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/learnapidoc/e/146076). I'm grateful to see many people who find enough value in the course to contribute back.

## PDF format

To read the same content in PDF format, see [Download PDFs](https://buymeacoffee.com/learnapidoc/e/146076). You can print out the section you want, or load it into a PDF reader to highlight/annotate content. You can also upload chapters into your favorite AI tool and interface with the content that way.

## Let me know if any content is out of date

One of the challenges in any technical course is ensuring the content stays up to date. Technology changes rapidly, and given the many hands-on activities in the course, it's easy for some steps to become out of date as time passes. I've tried to maintain a healthy balance between general and specific details in the content here. If you find something is out of date, either add a comment on that page or [let me know](https://idratherbewriting.com/contact/).

## Stay updated

If you're following this course, you most likely want to learn more about APIs. I publish regular articles that talk about APIs and strategies for documenting them. You can stay updated about these posts by [subscribing to my free newsletter](https://idratherbewriting.com/newsletter) through the form below. My newsletter, branded as the I'd Rather Be Writing newsletter, helps you stay updated about everything going on in the techcomm world, with a special emphasis on API documentation, docs-as-code tools, and lately AI.
