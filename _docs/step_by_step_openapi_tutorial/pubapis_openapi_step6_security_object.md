Swagger UI provides a "Try it out" feature that lets users submit actual requests. To submit requests that are authorized by your API server, the spec must contain security information that will authorize the request. The [`security` object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.1.md#securityRequirementObject) specifies the security or authorization protocol used when submitting requests.

## Which security scheme?

REST APIs can use different security approaches to authorize requests. I explored the most common authorization methods in [Authentication and authorization requirements](docapis_more_about_authorization.html). OpenAPI 3.1 supports several authorization schemes:

* API key (`apiKey`)
* HTTP (`http`) - for Basic, Bearer, and other HTTP authentication schemes.
* OAuth 2.0 (`oauth2`)
* OpenID Connect (`openIdConnect`)
* Mutual TLS (`mutualTLS`)

In this step of the OpenAPI tutorial, we'll use the API key approach, since this is what the OpenWeatherMap API uses. If your API uses [OAuth 2.0](docapis_more_about_authorization.html#oauth) or another method, you'll need to read the [Security Scheme Object documentation](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.1.md#security-scheme-object) for details on how to configure it. However, all the security methods mostly follow the same pattern.

{% include ads.html %}

## API key authorization

The sample OpenWeatherMap API we're using in this course uses an API key passed in the URL's query string (rather than in the header). If you submit a request without the API key in the query string (or without a valid API key), the server denies the request. For details on the OpenWeatherMap's authorization model, see [How to start](https://openweathermap.org/appid#use).

## Security object

At the root level of your OpenAPI document, add a `security` object that defines the global method for the API's security:

```yaml
security:
- app_id: []
```

`app_id` is the arbitrary name we gave to this security scheme in our `securitySchemes` object. We could have named it anything. We'll define `app_id` in `components`. The empty array `[]` indicates that no OAuth 2.0 scopes are required for this security scheme.

All paths will use the `app_id` security method by default unless it's overridden by a value at the [`path` object level](pubapis_openapi_step4_paths_object.html). For example, at the path level, we could overwrite the global security method as follows:

```yaml
/weather:
  get:
    ...
    security:
    - some_other_key: []
```

Then the `weather` path would use the `some_other_key` security method, while all other paths would use the globally declared security, `app_id`.

{% include content/troubleshooting_spec_tip.md %}

## Referencing the security scheme in components

In the [`components` object](pubapis_openapi_step5_components_object.html), add a [`securitySchemes` object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.1.md#securitySchemeObject) that defines details about the security scheme the API uses:

```yaml
components:
  ...

  securitySchemes:
    app_id:
      type: apiKey
      description: API key to authorize requests.
      name: appid
      in: query
```

Properties you can use for each item in the `securitySchemes` object include the following:

* `type`: The authorization protocol &mdash; `apiKey`, `http`, `oauth2`, `openIdConnect`, or `mutualTLS`.
* `description`: A description of your security method. In Swagger UI, this description appears in the Authorization modal (see the screenshot below). CommonMark Markdown is allowed.
* `name`: The name of the header, query, or cookie parameter to be used. Used only for `apiKey` type security.
* `in`: Specifies where the security key is applied. Options are `query`, `header` or `cookie`. Used only for `apiKey` type security.
* `scheme`: The name of the HTTP Authentication scheme. Used with `type: http`.
* `bearerFormat`: A hint to the client to identify how the bearer token is formatted. Used with `type: http`.
* [`flows`](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.1.md#oauthFlowsObject) (object): Configuration information for the flow types supported. Used with `type: oauth2`.
* `openIdConnectUrl`: A URL to discover the OpenID Connect provider's configuration. Used with `type: openIdConnect`.

In Swagger Editor, if you haven't already done so, insert the `security` object at the root level:

```yaml
security:
- app_id: []
```

And insert the `securitySchemes` object into `components` (indented at the same level as `parameters` and `schemas`):

```yaml
components:
  parameters:
  ...
  schemas:
  ...

  securitySchemes:
    app_id:
      type: apiKey
      description: API key to authorize requests.
      name: appid
      in: query
```

Then check out the Swagger UI display. You'll see an "Authorize" button appear.

<figure><img class="docimage" src="{{site.api_media}}/step6swaggeruiprogress.png" alt="Adding security information into the spec" /><figcaption>Adding security information into the spec</figcaption></figure>

When you click Authorize, the `description` and other security details appear:

<a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/assets/files/swagger/index.html" class="noExtIcon"><img src="{{site.api_media}}/openapitutorial_securityauth.png" class="medium"/></a>

After users enter an API key and click **Authorize**, the authorization method is set for as many requests as they want to make. The authorization session expires only when users refresh the page.

{% include image_ad_right.html %}

## <i class="fa fa-user-circle"></i> Test out how authorization works

Now that we've added authorization, let's try making an actual API request. In the Swagger Editor (the right pane), click the **Authorize** button, paste the sample API key shown in the description into the **Value** field (or use your own [OpenWeatherMap API key](docapis_get_auth_keys.html#openweathermap_apikey)), and click **Authorize**. Then click **Close** to close the authorization modal.

{% include random_ad4.html %}

In the Current Weather Data section, expand the **GET /weather** endpoint and click **Try it out**. In the **zip** field, enter your zip code and country abbreviation (such as `95050,us`), and then click **Execute**.

When you execute the request, Swagger UI shows you the [curl request](docapis_make_curl_call.html) submitted. For example, after executing a weather request, the curl is as follows:

```bash
curl -X GET "[https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip=95050%2Cus&units=imperial&lang=en&mode=json&appid=APIKEY](https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip=95050%2Cus&units=imperial&lang=en&mode=json&appid=APIKEY)" -H "accept: application/json"
```

(Replace APIKEY with your actual API key.)

The `&appid=APIKEY"` indicates that the API key is being included in the query string, so the request will be authorized. If you copy the curl submitted, customize the API key, and paste it into the command line, you'll see a successful response:

<figure><img class="docimage medium" src="{{site.api_media}}/curlrequestopenapiswagger.png" alt="Successful curl response" /><figcaption>Successful curl response</figcaption></figure>

The server response also appears directly in the Swagger UI display, with a link to download it:

```

Note that when you implement Swagger UI, if you find that the curl request works but the response doesn't appear in Swagger UI, there might be a CORS issue with your API blocking requests from web applications like Swagger.
