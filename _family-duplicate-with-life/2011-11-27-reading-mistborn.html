<p>All my life, I've never really read fantasy novels. About two months ago, I noticed one of my basketball buddies walking down the hall. Since I was an avid podcast listener, I asked him what he was listening to. He said <em>The Hunger Games</em>. I decided to try it, and immediately liked it, listening to the entire <em>Hunger Games</em> trilogy in about a month.</p>
<p>The next time I saw my friend, I told him he had hooked me on the <em>Hunger Games</em>. He said, If you like <em>Hunger Games</em>, then you will love <em>Mistborn</em>. I immediately downloaded the first <em>Mistborn</em> novel, by Brandon Sanderson. It turns out my friend was right. I absolutely love Mistborn. I even let Avery listen to it.</p>
<p>Avery is more taken by story than me, apparently. She will listen to Mistborn for hours on end.</p>

<p>I'm currently near the end of the second Mistborn book, <em>The Well of Ascension</em> (it's a trilogy). I sometimes go out on walks at night just so I can listen to the book. I could have ordered a print copy rather than listening to the audio version, but I actually love listening to the book. I listen to it every time I drive to work, every time I drive to pick up Avery from swimming, and even when I go early to play basketball.</p>
<p>I really enjoy listening to stories. And I can't understand why I've treated the fantasy genre with so much unwarranted disdain over the years. Sanderson is actually a local author, LDS and living in Provo. He had a signing at the BYU bookstore earlier this month to celebrate his latest release, <em>The Alloy of Law</em>. I would have gone with Avery except it was at midnight, so it was too late.</p>
<p>I think I will be a lifelong Audible listener. I was always into podcasts, but I'm even more obsessive about audio books. I listened to non-fiction books some months earlier (especially Bart Ehrman's books), but they never hooked me as much as fiction.</p>
<p>I think I am definitely an audial learner. When I am partly focused on something else, such as driving, walking, or shooting hoops, my mind is able to absorb the story with perfect attention.</p>
