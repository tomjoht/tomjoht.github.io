<p>It's been way too long since I've updated this blog. I am trying to get back into the habit.</p>
<p>I'm not sure where to start, so I decided to just upload some pictures and add some captions.<br />

<h2>Other details</h2>
<p>A long time ago, I had an idea for this blog. I was going to call it "Adventure Walking." But then I found that it was too difficult to put together adventure walks, and I ended up rebranding it "I'd Rather Be Telling Stories."</p>
<p>I think there's a lot of value in adventure outings. Today I rode down to the Old Fremont Open Space preserve, then rode along the Coyote Ridge Trail out to Stevens Creek County Park and up and around back to our house. It was about a 25 mile ride. I had a fun time exploring the trail system in the Open Preserve. I love discovering new places, even when they're so close to home. I want to get back into that sense of discovery.</p>
<p>I'm not exactly sure why the sense of discovery is so exhilarating -- it just is. I don't get the same sense of satisfaction when playing basketball.</p>
