<p>A few weeks ago I was riding out near Stevens Creek park when I came across a bicycle painted white. In front of it were two gravestones, giving memory to two cyclists who were killed by a motorist at that spot. </p>
<p>  <a href="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/2014/12/bike.png"><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/bike.png" alt="bike" width="600" height="450" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-697" /></a></p>
<p>One of the gravestones said, </p>
<p><a href="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/2014/12/matt.png"><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/matt.png" alt="matt" width="600" height="450" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-699" /></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rethink what is possible. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other gravestone said:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/2014/12/gough.png"><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.wasabisys.com/idbwmedia.com/images/gough.png" alt="gough" width="600" height="450" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-698" /></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Free from limitations and imaginary lines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I rode away, I thought about the second gravestone. I wondered if it was original and later, after some googling, found that it derives from a Walt Whitman poem called &#8220;Song of the Open Road&#8221;:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/236/119.html">Song of the Open Road</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>FROM this hour I ordain myself loos'd of limits and imaginary lines,<br />
Going where I list, my own master, total and absolute,<br />
Listening to others, and considering well what they say,<br />
Pausing, searching, receiving, contemplating,<br />
Gently, but with undeniable will, divesting myself of the holds that would hold me.</p>
<p>I inhale great draughts of space,<br />
The east and the west are mine, and the north and the south are mine.</p>
<p>I am larger, better than I thought,<br />
I did not know I held so much goodness. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It turns out that the cyclist with the &#8220;Free from limitations&#8221; quote was <a href="http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/houstonchronicle/obituary.aspx?pid=105725358">Kristy Gough</a>, a champion in the triathlon world who had won her age group in the Hawaii Ironman (the most prestigious triathlon event).</p>
<p>One reason the quotation from the gravestone, or Whitman&#8217;s bold line &#8220;From this hour I ordain myself loos'd of limits and imaginary lines,&#8221; made such an impression on me is not because I&#8217;m also a cyclist and concerned about meeting my own death from a stray car on a winding mountain road. Actually, when I think of being free from limitations and imaginary lines, I think of the personal transition my wife and I made about 9 months ago when we said goodbye to religion.</p>
<p>My wife was born and raised Mormon, and her 4 siblings and parents are still active, straight-arrow Mormons. I was a convert to the church at age 16, introduced to the church through a childhood friend. I later spent 2 years as a missionary in Venezuela, graduated from Brigham Young University, and worked for the Church&#8217;s IT department for 5 years. Even so, I was the only Mormon in my small family. It was easy to tell my family I was leaving, but much more difficult for my wife, Shannon.</p>
<p>Returning to embrace a typical world-view was not so difficult. After the first few weeks of playing basketball on Sunday, or going to a museum instead of church, or drinking a vanilla mocha, it just seemed normal to do those things. </p>
<p>I doubt many of those reading my tech-comm focused blog care about reasons why we left. There are a tremendous number of positive things I learned from being Mormon. For example, organizational skills, looking after others, leadership, relationship-building, living a drug-free life. Who knows what I avoided in my early twenties thanks to the health and moral codes. Mormons prize education, continual learning, self-reliance, wholesomeness, families, expanding your talents, helping your neighbor, participating in government, supporting your country, maintaining your integrity, being honest, developing outdoor skills, and more. </p>
<p>At the same time, the Mormon church promotes a sexism that is pervasive and stifling. It's rooted deeply in a patriarchal tradition. The church promotes a culture of close-minded thinking, sanitizes and distorts its history, is based on doctrines that just don&#8217;t make sense to me (from the atonement to polygamy), has an unapologetic history of racism, and more. Most of all, the church's promotion of stay-at-home motherhood as the only righteous option for women made my wife frustrated and unhappy. </p>
<p>Since leaving the Mormon faith, we haven&#8217;t embraced any new religion. We tried attending a liberal Presbyterian church, and then a Universalist Unitarian church, but once you become soured on one religious institution, you become extremely wary of other institutions. (In fact, I started to wonder, the other week, whether DITA might be a cult &#8211; I get that wary.)</p>
<p>Instead of adopting some other religion, I like to think of myself as &#8220;free from limitations and imaginary lines.&#8221; Seeing the world without the boundaries of religion brings different things in focus. I have more respect and awe for the miracle of life, whether it came about as a gradual evolutionary process or some other means. </p>
<p>Why am I posting this on my technical writing blog? In part, I know that my Linkedin profile will forever brand me as Mormon due to my work history at the &#8220;Presiding Bishopric.&#8221; (It still was an extremely cool place to work, one that proved to be a lot more normal and secular than I imagined.) And having four young children in California is a dead giveaway that we have some link to religion.</p>
<p>For any online impressions that I make, I want to symbolize free, unbridled thought, independent of any particular tool, authoring methodology, group, or institution. I am a technical writer and a blogger. I explore questions I find interesting. I process and share my experiences and insights. Because I&#8217;m curious and open-minded, I try new things &#8211; sometimes they succeed, and sometimes they fail. </p>
<p>Free from limitations and imaginary lines, I go where I want, and am &#8220;my own master, total and absolute &#8211; listening to others, and considering well what they say. Pausing, searching, receiving, contemplating. Gently, but with undeniable will, divesting myself of the holds that would hold me.&#8221;</p></p>
